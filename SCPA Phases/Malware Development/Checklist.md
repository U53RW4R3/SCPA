TODO: Provide a checklist for developing implants with a general context to improve evasion success rate

## Data Integrity

- [ ] Ensure your malware isn't tampered. Use digest hash algorithm.

## Whitelisting

- [ ] List of MAC Addresses.
- [ ] List of IP Addresses.

## Blacklisting

- [ ] List of MAC Addresses.
- [ ] List of IP Addresses.
- [ ] Block WinAPI and NtAPI code injection (look more into this for mapping DLLs).

## Greylisting

- [ ] It's in the form of both whitelisting and blacklisting.

## Anti-Sandbox
