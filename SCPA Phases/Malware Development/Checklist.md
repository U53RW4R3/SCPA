# Checklist

TODO: Provide a checklist for developing implants with a general context to improve evasion success rate

## Sandbox

### General

- Gather information of the hardware specifications. Here are the list:
	- [ ] Architecture 
	- [ ] Number of core processors and threads.
	- [ ] Memory capacity (RAM).
	- Storage Capacity
		- [ ] Free Storage
		- [ ] Used Storage
	- MAC Address
		- [ ] Motherboard
		- [ ] Network Adapters
	- [ ] Monitors
	- [ ] GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit)/Display Adapters
- Detect third party programs are installed in the machine. These include:
	- Debuggers
	- Hypervisor
		- [ ] VirtualBox
		- [ ] VMWare
		- [ ] QEMU/KVM SPICE
- Detect network configuration in the machine.
	- [ ] Check if it's in a isolated network.
	- [ ] Retrieve Geolocation of the IP address.
	- [ ] Specify a list of blocked IP addresses.
### Windows

- [ ] Restrict to specific Windows build and operating system version.
- [ ] Check registry values for security solutions.
- Check for display drivers. Here are the following list:
	1. Monitors
		- [ ] Non-PnP (Plug n Play)
- Detect other system drivers. These include:
	- Hypervisor
		- [ ] VirtualBox
		- [ ] VMWare
		- [ ] QEMU/KVM SPICE

	- Debuggers
	- Hypervisor
		- [ ] VirtualBox
		- [ ] VMWare
		- [ ] QEMU/KVM SPICE
- Detect third party programs are installed in the machine. These include:
	- [ ] Process Hacker
	- Debuggers
		- Dynamic Debuggers
			- [ ] x64dbg and x32dbg

## Evasion

### Cryptography

- [ ] Use symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithms that are covered in **Cryptography** section.
- [ ] Change the encryption configuration patterns.

### Compression

- [ ] Add compression algorithm.

### Obfuscation

#### General

- [ ] Rename variables.
- [ ] Disguise the shellcode.
