# Checklist

TODO: Provide a checklist for developing implants with a general context to improve evasion success rate

## Sandbox

### General

- [ ] Gather information of the system architecture such as the specs

### Windows

- [ ] Restrict to specific Windows build and operating system version
- [ ] Check registry values for security solutions
- Check for display drivers. Here are the following list:
	1. Monitors
		- [ ] Non-PnP (Plug n Play)

## Evasion

### Encryption

- [ ] Use symmetric encryption algorithms. Here are the following examples:
	- XOR
	- RC4
	- AES

### Obfuscation

#### General

- [ ] Rename variables.
- [ ] Disguise the shellcode.
