# Checklist

TODO: Provide a checklist for developing implants with a general context to improve evasion success rate

## Sandbox

### General

- Gather information of the hardware specifications. Here are the list:
	- [ ] Number of core processors.
	- [ ] Memory capacity (RAM).
	- Storage Capacity
		- [ ] Free Storage
		- [ ] Used Storage
	- MAC Address
		- [ ] Motherboard
		- [ ] Network Adapters
	- [ ] Monitors
	- [ ] GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)/Display Adapter

### Windows

- [ ] Restrict to specific Windows build and operating system version.
- [ ] Check registry values for security solutions.
- Check for display drivers. Here are the following list:
	1. Monitors
		- [ ] Non-PnP (Plug n Play)

## Evasion

### Cryptography

- [ ] Use symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithms that are covered in **Cryptography** section.
- [ ] Change the encryption configuration patterns.

### Compression

- [ ] Add compression algorithm.

### Obfuscation

#### General

- [ ] Rename variables.
- [ ] Disguise the shellcode.
