## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] Use [[Wapiti|wapiti]] to find potential blind SQL injection exploits.
- [ ] Run [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/SQL Injection/Scanners/Nikto|nikto]] scanner to discover for existing blind SQL injection exploits.
- [ ] You can use XSS scanners to perform and inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads for heuristic checks as a probable indicator for blind SQL injection exploits.

	- [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Cross Site Scripting (XSS)/Scanners/XSStrike/Usage|XSStrike]]
- [ ] Run an [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/SQL Injection/Scanners/Nmap|NSE script]] to probe for blind SQL injection vulnerabilities on the web servers with `-iL ip_targets.txt` flag.
- [ ] Using [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/SQL Injection/Scanners/Nuclei|Nuclei]] with fuzzer templates to discover GET request URLs with blind SQL injection vulnerabilities and other indicators of PHP syntax code disclosure.
- [ ] Run [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/SQL Injection/Scanners/Metasploit|metasploit]] auxiliary scanner module to find blind SQL injection vulnerabilities on the web servers.

#### Content Management System

- [ ] Run [[WPScan|WPScan]] to check for vulnerable wordpress plugins or themes related to blind SQL injection.
- [ ] Run [[Joomscan]] to check for vulnerable joomla plugins or themes related to blind SQL injection.

## Exploit

### Manual Injection on Parameters

- Refer to [[Inferential SQL Queries]] to aid to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Common Parameters

- [ ] Check the top parameters in [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/01 - Passive Fingerprinting/OSINT/Search Engines Dorking/Google Dorking/Dorks/Web Enumeration/SQL Injection/Manual|google dorks]].

#### GET Request

- [ ] Check the URL parameters.
- [ ] Check the URI parameters.
- [ ] Perform on numeric parameters with mathematical expression as a probable indicator for blind SQL injection. In **SQLMap** this can be possible with `--invalid-bignum` flag.
- [ ] Perform on parameters with logical operators as a probable indicator for blind SQL injection. In **SQLMap** this can be possible with `--invalid-logical` flag.
- [ ] Perform on parameters with random strings as a probable indicator for blind SQL injection. In **SQLMap** this can be possible with `--invalid-string` flag.

#### POST Request

- [ ] Perform username enumeration to craft the blind SQL injection if necessary.
- [ ] Check JSON parameters.
- [ ] POST parameters may contain in SOAP/XML.

### Manual Injection on Headers

TODO: Fill the rest of the HTTP headers

- [ ] Inject **Cookie headers**
- [ ] Inject **User-Agent**
- [ ] Inject **Referrer**
- [ ] Inject **X-Forwarded-For**
- [ ] Inject **X-Forwarded-Host**
- [ ] Inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads as a probable indicator of blind SQL injection.

### Blind SQL Injection Responses

#### Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection

##### Page Comparison

- Compare responses of what conditions are needed:
	- [ ] Trigger valid response of what input accepts.
	- [ ] Trigger invalid response of what outputs the error.
	- [ ] Conditional error response.
	- [ ] Observe title webpage response.
	- [ ] Observe HTTP status code.

##### Authentication Bypass

- [ ] Perform Boolean-based SQL injection to bypass authentication. In **SQLMap** you can specify `--technique=B` flag which allows you to dump the database credentials. Whatever based on your enumeration gathering based on the webapp response include these flags to narrow it down: 
	-  `--string` for single response or `--regexp` multiple responses if returned true. `--code=200` if HTTP code status is true or `--code=401` if HTTP code status is false.
	- `--not-string` for single response if returned false.
	- To perform another check to highest success rate of SQL injection exploit add `--titles` flag to compare the webpages based on title response.

#### Time-Based Blind SQL Injection

Note: If the vulnerability scanner (e.g. Acunetix) was able to exploit with an XOR operator such as, `XOR(if(now()=sysdate(),sleep(10),0))OR`. Consider specifying boundaries (`--prefix=""`) and/or (`--suffix=""`) without anything included.

- Compare responses of what conditions are needed:
	- [ ] Trigger valid response of what input accepts.
	- [ ] Trigger invalid response of what outputs the error.
	- [ ] Observe HTTP status code.

- [ ] In **SQLMap** using Time-based blind query (`--technique=T`). To narrow it down: 
	- `--time-sec` to increase the sleep delay response

### Data Collection

#### Login Panels

- [ ] Find an login (admin) panel to login the credentials you've obtained from the current database. Use [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Crawlers and Directory Bruteforce/Gobuster|gobuster]] if you must.
- [ ] If possible you can use another inferential SQL injection technique, otherwise stick with boolean-based technique.

#### DBMS Credentials

- [ ] After you successfully exploited the parameters. Extract the DBMS credentials to authenticate the database server. You can perform this in [[05 - Credentials|SQLMap]].
- [ ] Run a port scanner to discover DBMS open ports.
	- [[01 - Quick Scan|Nmap]]
	- [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/02 - Active Fingerprinting/Port Scanners/Naabu|Naabu]]

### Initial Foothold

#### Webshell

TODO: Write more about this

##### Enumerate Web Root Directory

- Discover and enumerate the web root directory.
	- [ ] Find syntax errors or warning messages to find a web root directory.
	- [ ] A directory path where to upload files.

##### Upload File

- [ ] After successfully exploiting blind SQL injection. Upload a webshell if possible.

### Exploit Chaining

- [ ] If **SQLMap** detects the blind SQL injection parameters with positive heuristic checks of XSS. Craft an [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Cross Site Scripting (XSS)/Lab Simulation/01 - DVWA/Stored XSS/Difficulty/Low/Manual#^a7f343|XSS payload]] then insert it in the database to steal cookie sessions.
