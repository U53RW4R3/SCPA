TODO: Demonstrate any auxiliary and exploit module to use it as a vulnerability scanner

### 2.1 - Exploit Modules as Scanners

- Some exploit modules contain a `check` command to scan a target to confirm if it's vulnerable or not.

```
msf > use exploit/windows/http/exchange_proxyshell_rce

msf exploit(windows/http/exchange_proxyshell_rce) > options

msf exploit(windows/http/exchange_proxyshell_rce) > set rhosts <IP>

msf exploit(windows/http/exchange_proxyshell_rce) > set rport <PORT>

msf exploit(windows/http/exchange_proxyshell_rce) > check
```
