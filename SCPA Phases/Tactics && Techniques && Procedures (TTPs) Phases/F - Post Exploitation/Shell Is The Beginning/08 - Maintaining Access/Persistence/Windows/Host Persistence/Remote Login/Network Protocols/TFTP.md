# TFTP

## 01 - Conditions

- Enable/Disable Windows features with Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM):
- This requires system privileges.
- For `Dism.exe` to work on x86_64 (64 bit) operating system, and executing commands as an absolute path are necessary

## 02 - Enable TFTP Server/Client

To list features which can be enabled/disabled:

`C:\> %windir%\System32\cmd.exe /c "%SystemRoot%\system32\Dism.exe" /online /get-features`

To enable a feature (TFTP client for example):

`%windir%\System32\cmd.exe /c "%SystemRoot%\system32\Dism.exe" /online /enable-feature /featurename:TFTP`

To disable a feature (again TFTP client):

`%windir%\System32\cmd.exe /c "%SystemRoot%\system32\Dism.exe" /online /disable-feature /featurename:TFTP`
