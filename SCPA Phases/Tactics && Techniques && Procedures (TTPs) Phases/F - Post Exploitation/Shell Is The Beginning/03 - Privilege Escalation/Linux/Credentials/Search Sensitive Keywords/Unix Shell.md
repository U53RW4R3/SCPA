# Unix Shell

Find something that is related to credentials.

```
$ grep -i "user\|pass" file.txt

$ grep -C 5 "password" file.txt

$ find . -name "*.php" -print0 2>/dev/null | xargs -0 grep -i -n "var $password"

$ grep -E "(user|username|login|pass|password|pw|credentials)[=:]" /etc/fstab /etc/mtab

$ find / -type f -exec grep -i -I "PASSWORD" {} /dev/null \;

$ find / -type f -exec grep -i -I "PASSWORD\|PASS=" {} /dev/null \;
```

Look for the enumeration phase related to running process that is related to user rights context of [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/F - Post Exploitation/Shell Is The Beginning/01 - Enumeration and Discovery/Linux/Processes and Services/Manual/Living off the Land]] There are services that have a possibility that stores the credentials in plain text. Run the command `ps aux`, retrieve the Process ID (PID), run it against with a debugger.

```
$ gdb -p <service_name>

$ gdb <pid>
```
