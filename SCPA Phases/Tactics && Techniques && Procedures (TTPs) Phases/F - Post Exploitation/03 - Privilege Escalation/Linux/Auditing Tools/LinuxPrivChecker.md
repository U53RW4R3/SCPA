# LinuxPrivChecker

When dropping the LinuxPrivChecker on the Linux target it must have `python3` preinstalled.

```
$ ./linuxprivchecker.py
```

If you're trying to target the older Linux systems or embedded devices. You'll might use these two.

```
$ python2 ./linuxprivchecker.py.old

$ ./linuxprivchecker.sh
```
