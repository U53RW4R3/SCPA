## Information Gathering

### Passive Reconnaissance

#### Passive Enumeration

- [ ] Use [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/01 - Passive Fingerprinting/Enumeration/Network Protocols/HTTP/Whatweb|whatweb]] to fingerprint the server. This includes:
	- [ ] Web Server Software
	- Content Management System (CMS)
		- [ ] Plugins
		- [ ] Themes
	- [ ] Portals
	- [ ] Database Backend (DBMS)
	- [ ] Panels
	- [ ] Forums
	- [ ] Web Framework
	- Security Defenses
		- [ ] Web App Firewall (WAF) or IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
		- [ ] Honeypots

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] You can use XSS scanners to perform and inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads for heuristic checks as a probable indicator for SSTI exploits.
	- [[Dalfox]]
- [ ] Using [[Webapps|Nuclei]] with fuzzer templates to discover GET request URLs with SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Exploit

- [ ] Try to inject XSS payloads and then perform the mathematical expressions 

### Manual Injection on Headers

TODO: Fill the rest of the HTTP headers

- [ ] Inject **Cookie headers**
- [ ] Inject **User-Agent**
- [ ] Inject **X-Forwarded-For**
- [ ] Inject **X-Forwarded-Host**
