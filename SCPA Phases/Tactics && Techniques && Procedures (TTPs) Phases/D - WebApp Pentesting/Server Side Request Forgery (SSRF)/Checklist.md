## Information Gathering

### Passive Reconnaissance

#### Passive Enumeration

- [ ] Use [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/01 - Passive Fingerprinting/Enumeration/Network Protocols/HTTP/Whatweb|whatweb]] to fingerprint the server. This includes:
	- [ ] Web Server Software
	- Content Management System (CMS)
		- [ ] Plugins
		- [ ] Themes
	- [ ] Portals
	- [ ] Database Backend (DBMS)
	- [ ] Panels
	- [ ] Forums
	- [ ] Web Framework
	- Embedded devices/IoTs
		- [ ] Routers
		- [ ] VPN appliances
	- General information
		- [ ] Author
		- [ ] Emails
		- [ ] IP Addresses
		- [ ] Country
		- [ ] Geolocation
		- [ ] Generator Tags
	- Security Defenses
		- [ ] Web App Firewall (WAF) or IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
		- [ ] Honeypots

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] Use [[Wapiti|wapiti]] to find potential SSRF exploits.
- [ ] You can use scanners to perform open redirects for heuristic checks as a probable indicator for SSRF exploits.
	- Scanner name
- [ ] Run an [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - WebApp Pentesting/Open Redirect/Scanners/Nmap|NSE script]] to probe for open redirect vulnerabilities on the webservers with `-iL ip_targets.txt` flag.
- [ ] Using [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - WebApp Pentesting/Open Redirect/Scanners/Nuclei|nuclei]] with fuzzer templates to discover GET request URLs with open redirect vulnerabilities.

- [ ] Open Redirect
