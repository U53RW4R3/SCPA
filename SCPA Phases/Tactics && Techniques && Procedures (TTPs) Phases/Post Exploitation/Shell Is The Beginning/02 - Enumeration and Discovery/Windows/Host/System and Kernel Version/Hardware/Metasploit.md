# Metasploit

`meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/enum_devices`

- Show mounted drives.

```
meterpreter > show_mount

meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/forensics/enum_drives [maxdrives=<number_of_drives>]
```

- Check if there are external USB drives history activity to the workstation. This will provide leverage to insert malware to spread the infection or possibly to exfiltrate data.

`meterpreter > run post/windows/gather/usb_history`
