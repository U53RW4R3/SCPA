This information especially for the **`System Access`** as previously mentioned we have to look at the **`MinimumPasswordLength`** and **`PasswordComplexity`**. Passwords with complexity that may contains the following:

1. Must meet the minimum length of the password

2. Alphabetic letters that are uppercase and lowercase at least one of them each
