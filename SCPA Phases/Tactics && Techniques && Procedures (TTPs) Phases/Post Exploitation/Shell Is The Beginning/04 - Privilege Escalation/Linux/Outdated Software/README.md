# Description

When exploiting outdated software that comes with native binaries for GNU/Linux operating system. Exploiting kernels is the last resort because it does pose a risk of causing the machine to crash. This is why it's better to find any third-party vendors or the preinstalled executables that Linux comes with. It is often time-consuming to do it manually which is why we need auditing tools to perform it automatically for us.

I suggest using **LES (Linux-Exploit-Suggester), LinPEAS** or **Metasploit's own module** `post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` when it comes with this type of situation. Head to the **Auditing Tools** section below that is related to Linux privilege escalation.
