# NetOnly

This can be appropriately used for moving the active directory network laterally, and it's also part of [[Token Impersonation]] methods.

```
C:\> runas /netonly /user:<DOMAIN>\<username> C:\path\to\shell.exe

C:\> runas /noprofile /netonly /user:<DOMAIN>\<username> C:\path\to\shell.exe
```

If you're using a C2 framework then you pipe it through instead entering the password in a prompt.

```
C:\> cmd /c <password> | runas /netonly /user:<DOMAIN>\<username> C:\path\to\shell.exe

C:\> echo <password> | runas /netonly /user:<DOMAIN>\<username> C:\path\to\shell.exe
```
