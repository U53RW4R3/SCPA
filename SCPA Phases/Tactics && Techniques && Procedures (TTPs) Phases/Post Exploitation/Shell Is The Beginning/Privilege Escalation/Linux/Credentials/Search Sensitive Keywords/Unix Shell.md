# Unix Shell

- **Find something that is related to credentials**

`$ grep -i user file.txt`

`$ grep -i pass file.txt`

`$ grep -C 5 "password" file.txt`

`$ find . -name "*.php" -print0 2>/dev/null | xargs -0 grep -i -n "var $password"`

`$ grep -E "(user|username|login|pass|password|pw|credentials)[=:]" /etc/fstab /etc/mtab`

`$ find / -type f -exec grep -i -I "PASSWORD" {} /dev/null \;`

`$ find / -type f -exec grep -i -I "PASSWORD\|PASS=" {} /dev/null \;`

Look for the enumeration phase related to running process that is related to user rights context of [[Processes and Services]] There are services that have a possibility that stores the credentials in plain text. Run the command `ps aux`, retrieve the Process ID (PID), run it against with a debugger.

`$ gdb -p <service_name>`

`$ gdb <pid>`
