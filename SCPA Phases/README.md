The **SCPA (Sophicated Cyber Penetration Attacks)** is for hackers wanting a straight guidance with many sections involves in offensive operations. It outlines in a systematic approach, because there are so many resources that are being broadcast on the internet. I've compiled it together which contains sources have been re-applied providing use cases and scenarios in many ways.

I'm Userware and I've started this project due to my experience that contains tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) and I've collected a lot of information just to summarize it all in one. I find it a waste that nobody would go thorough this effort especially for beginners who are still starting out. This knowledge will serve you well in your journey.
