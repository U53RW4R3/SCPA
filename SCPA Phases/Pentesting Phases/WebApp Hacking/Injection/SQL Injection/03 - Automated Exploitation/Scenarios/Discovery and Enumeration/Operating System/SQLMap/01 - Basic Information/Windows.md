## Conditions

1. The DB user must have **FILE** and **SELECT** privileges perform with the flags `--privileges -U CU`.
2. **Note:** Not all files are readable unless the current user is `root@<IP>` (e.g. `root@localhost`). You'll notice that you can't fetch SSH credentials which is normal due to security reasons.

## Automated

- DNS resolve and nameserver IPs
