Refer to [[Lab Simulation Setup/Webapps/DVWA/Setup#^214bb7|DVWA Lab Setup]] for the attacker machine to map the IP address in the `/etc/hosts`.

We have to understand from the developer's perspective. Then re-apply for the `$id` parameter. The webserver has PHP code as a server side. Let's take this PHP one line code as example. When the user authenticate to the form with his credentials which also can be exploited with unsantized user input.

TODO: Provide the full basic source code of authentication for PHP

```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password';"
```

The boolean conditions that helps us to look for differences in the web application's response.

```sql
' OR 1=1 --
' OR 1=2 --
```

The database server will not interpret it as PHP code. It will only recognize SQL queries and evaluate it. Observe when you include the boundaries by adding the single quote (`'`) as suffix and escaping it with comments (`--`) as prefix. Then in the middle of the SQL query containing a logical operator (`OR`) and always evaluate the response as true (`1=1`). 

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = 'password123';
```
