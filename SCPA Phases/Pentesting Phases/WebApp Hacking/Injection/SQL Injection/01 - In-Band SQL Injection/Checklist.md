## Scanners

- [ ] Use [[Wapiti]] to find potential SQL injection exploits.

- [ ] Using [[Nuclei]] with fuzzer templates to discover GET request URLs.

- [ ] If **SQLMap** detects the SQL injection parameters might be vulnerable. Craft an [[Pentesting Phases/WebApp Hacking/Injection/Cross Site Scripting (XSS)/Lab/01 - DVWA/Stored XSS/Difficulty/Low/Manual#^a7f343|XSS Payload]] then insert it in the database to steal cookie sessions.
