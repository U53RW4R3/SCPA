```powershell
<#  
.SYNOPSIS  
 Writes a large file full of zeroes to a volume in order to allow a storage  
 appliance to reclaim unused space.  
  
.DESCRIPTION  
 Creates a file called ThinSAN.tmp on the specified volume that fills the  
 volume up to leave only the percent free value (default is 5%) with zeroes.  
 This allows a storage appliance that is thin provisioned to mark that drive  
 space as unused and reclaim the space on the physical disks.  
   
.PARAMETER Root  
 The folder to create the zeroed out file in.  This can be a drive root (c:\)  
 or a mounted folder (m:\mounteddisk).  This must be the root of the mounted  
 volume, it cannot be an arbitrary folder within a volume.  
   
.PARAMETER PercentFree  
 A float representing the percentage of total volume space to leave free.  The  
 default is .05 (5%)  
  
.EXAMPLE  
 PS> Write-ZeroesToFreeSpace -Root "c:\"  
   
 This will create a file of all zeroes called c:\ThinSAN.tmp that will fill the  
 c drive up to 95% of its capacity.  
   
.EXAMPLE  
 PS> Write-ZeroesToFreeSpace -Root "c:\MountPoints\Volume1" -PercentFree .1  
   
 This will create a file of all zeroes called  
 c:\MountPoints\Volume1\ThinSAN.tmp that will fill up the volume that is  
 mounted to c:\MountPoints\Volume1 to 90% of its capacity.  
  
.EXAMPLE  
 PS> Get-WmiObject Win32_Volume -filter "drivetype=3" | Write-ZeroesToFreeSpace  
   
 This will get a list of all local disks (type=3) and fill each one up to 95%  
 of their capacity with zeroes.  
   
.NOTES  
 You must be running as a user that has permissions to write to the root of the  
 volume you are running this script against. This requires elevated privileges  
 using the default Windows permissions on the C drive.
