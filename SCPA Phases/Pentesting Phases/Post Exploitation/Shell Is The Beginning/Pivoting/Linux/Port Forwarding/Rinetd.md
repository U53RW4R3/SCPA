# Rinetd

## Usage

The `rinetd` program is short for **Internet Redirection Server** is self-explanatory as it suggests for port forwarding. We as an attacker must make a server as a phishing/honeypot to fetch credentials to prepare some kind of social engineering in the network of whatever enterprise organization due to varies situations or another way to evade blacklisted IP addresses in the local network. We need a port 
forwarding to redirect the traffic to make it look normal.

`$ cat /etc/rinetd.conf`
