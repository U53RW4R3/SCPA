# HTTP Tunneling

## 01 - Usage

HTTP Tunneling will encapsulate any protocol of whatever port you're trying to port forward it. This is not commonly used and it's great way to circumvent deep packet inspection since the network traffic stream will display as as there's a webserver interaction or something so it will be harder to detect since it is commonly used.

- Syntax

```
$ hts --forward-port localhost:<bind_port> <local_port>

$ htc --forward-port <local_port> <HTTPTunnel_server_IP> <bind_port>
```

## 02 - Scenarios

### 2.1 - Bind SSH Port

- HTTP Proxy tunnel server (target)

`$ hts --forward-port localhost:22 80`

- HTTP Proxy tunnel client (attacker)

```
$ htc --forward-port 4848 <HTTPTunnel_server_IP>:80

$ ssh -p 4848 <username>@localhost
```
