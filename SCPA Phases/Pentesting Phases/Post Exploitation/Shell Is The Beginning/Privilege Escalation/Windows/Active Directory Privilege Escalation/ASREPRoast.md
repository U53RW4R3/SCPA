## 01 - Impacket

Refer to [[Pentesting Phases/Information Gathering/Active Fingerprinting/Enumeration/Kerberos#^7e8f5e|Active Enumeration]] section for ASREPRoast

## 02 - Rubeus

TODO: Provide more example use cases

Same exact approach like for the ServicePrincipalName for Kerberoasting as the same as the following two conditions for it. However, the only different in different hash encryption since we are ASREPRoasting (refer to [[JTR#^0c9a3c|JTR]] or [[Hashcat#^6d0af5|Hashcat]] section **under Offline Password Cracking**).

`C:\> Rubeus.exe asreproast [/simple] /nowrap`
