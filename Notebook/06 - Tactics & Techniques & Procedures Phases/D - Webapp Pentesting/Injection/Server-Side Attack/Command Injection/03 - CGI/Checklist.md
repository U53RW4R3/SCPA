### Active Reconnaissance

#### Active Enumeration

- [ ] Probing ports to check what service version of the web servers using [[02 - Scan Techniques|nmap]].
- [ ] Find common directories with a list of [[Shellshock List|Common Gateway Interface (CGI)]] or perform [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/0x05 - Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Content Discovery/Web Directories/Bruteforce Directories/Metasploit|web crawling or directory bruteforce]].
- [ ] Perform [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/0x05 - Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Content Discovery/Web Directories/Bruteforce Directories/Metasploit|directory bruteforce]] after checking CGIs directories on the webserver to find specific file extensions: `.sh`, `.pl`, and `.py`.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] Run [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/Command Injection/Helpers/Scanners|nikto]] scanner to discover for existing shellshock exploits.
- [ ] Use [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/Command Injection/Helpers/Scanners|wapiti]] to find potential shellshock exploits.
- [ ] Run an [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/Command Injection/Helpers/Scanners|NSE script]] to probe for shellshock vulnerabilities on the web servers with `-iL ip_targets.txt`.

## Exploit

- [ ] Run with [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/Command Injection/04 - Automated Exploitation/Commix/Usage/Commix|commix]] using the `--shellshock` module to test for command injections.
