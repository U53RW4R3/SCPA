# Checklist

TODO: Fill the checklist for authorization bypass

## Information Gathering

### Active Reconnaissance

#### Active Enumeration

##### Discover Ports

- [ ] Probing ports to check what service version of the web servers using [[02 - Scan Techniques|nmap]].

##### Probe HTTP Port

- [ ] [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x02 - Active Fingerprinting/Network Ports/Cross Platform/HTTP/01 - Banner Grab/Scanners|Banner Grab]]
- [ ] [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x02 - Active Fingerprinting/Network Ports/Cross Platform/HTTP/02 - HTTP Title/Scanners|HTTP Title]]

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

- [[4-ZERO-3]]

## Exploits

- [ ] Change the [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Broken Access control/Server-Side Attack/Authorization Bypass/HTTP Error Code Bypass/Helpers/Payloads#^40b259|HTTP request]] method.
- [ ] Set [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Broken Access control/Server-Side Attack/Authorization Bypass/HTTP Error Code Bypass/Helpers/Payloads#^d0c9f6|HTTP header]], [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Broken Access control/Server-Side Attack/Authorization Bypass/HTTP Error Code Bypass/Helpers/Payloads#^178d6b|IP address and/or ports]].
- [ ] Downgrade [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Broken Access control/Server-Side Attack/Authorization Bypass/HTTP Error Code Bypass/Helpers/Payloads#^f50a50|HTTP protocol version]].
- Perform a quick recon to bypass the HTTP error code with the following DNS queries:
	- [ ] CNAME

- [ ] Check for multiple logins attempts.
