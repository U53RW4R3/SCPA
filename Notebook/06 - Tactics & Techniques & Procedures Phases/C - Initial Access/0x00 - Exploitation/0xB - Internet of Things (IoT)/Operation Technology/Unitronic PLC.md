# Unitronic PLC

## Recon Gathering

Unitronics devices, some of our recent ICS attacks had a new approach that shocked a few people and we got some questions on it was the targets where we showed off the HMI's for them. Those are Unitronics Device this writeup will be a tutorial on how you can also access and breach these devices. Lets start with finding these devices there are 2 ways:

1. The typical security engine like shodan with a few dorks to use:

![[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x01 - Passive Fingerprinting/0xD - Network Ports/IoTs/Operation Technology/Unitronic PLC#^894eae]]

2. You can gather a bunch of [[Gathering IP Blocks|CIDR]] and make a access control list then [[PCOM|scan the ranges]] for port `20256`. I recommend using [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x02 - Active Fingerprinting/Port Scanners/Rustscan|rustscan]] for quick scan and most accurate results.

## Prerequisites

Once thats done let's [install](https://www.unitronicsplc.com/software-visilogic-for-programmable-controllers/) the required program to remotely connect to the unitronics devices.

## Authentication

You open visilogic and head to the connection tab and then press the last option (communication and os) from there set the connection type to TCP call and configure the project settings 

## Situational Awareness

Now you see this scary panel? Well don't be scared. For IP address that's self explanatory which is the target. The port is whatever the targets port is. Now for the PLC name. **THIS STEP IS NECESSARY!**

Be it shodan or your scans you will usually have the PLC name INSERT THAT THE EXACT WAY ITS WRITTEN IN YOUR RESULTS

After that press okay and once back on the communication and OS page, press get OPLC information if you see the information loaded its safe to close the tab out now go back to connection and press online test or simply press F9 on your keyboard.

Once that's done you can press the (play button) and you officially accessed the unitronics PLC.

## Exploitation

From here we do recommend research on using this software and how to properly achieve what you want and destroying industrial systems (Via videos or the same download link from above check out the manual, etc etc)
