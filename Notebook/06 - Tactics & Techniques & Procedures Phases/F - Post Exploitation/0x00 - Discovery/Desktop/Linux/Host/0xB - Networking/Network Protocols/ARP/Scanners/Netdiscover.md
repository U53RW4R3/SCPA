# #netdiscover

Another way to install the program without root permissions is by downloading the package and extract it.

```
$ apt download netdiscover

$ dpkg -x netdiscover_*.deb work
```

Then you can just execute the program as it was portable.

```
$ work/usr/sbin/netdiscover -h
```

Specify the network range with an interface.

```
$ sudo netdiscover -i <interface> -r <IP>/<CIDR> -P | tee ip_targets.txt
```

Fast scan the network.

```
$ sudo netdiscover -i <interface> -f -P | tee ip_targets.txt
```

Perform a passive scan to sniff ARP connections.

```
$ sudo netdiscover -p -P | tee ip_targets.txt
```
