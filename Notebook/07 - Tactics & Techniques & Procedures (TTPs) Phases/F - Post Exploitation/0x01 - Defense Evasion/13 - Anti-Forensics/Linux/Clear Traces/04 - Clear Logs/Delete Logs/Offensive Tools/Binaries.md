## 01 - CoverMyAss

### 1.1 - Help Menu

```
$ ./covermyass -h
Covermyass is a post-exploitation tool for pen-testers that finds then erases log files on the current machine. The tool scans the filesystem and look for known log files that can be erased. Files are overwritten multiple times with random data, in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the data. Running this tool with root privileges is safe and even recommended to avoid access permission errors. This tool does not perform any network call.

Usage:
  covermyass [flags]

Examples:

Overwrite log files as well as those found by path /db/*.log
covermyass --write -p /db/*.log

Overwrite log files 5 times with a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding
covermyass --write -z -n 5


Flags:
  -f, --filter strings   File paths to ignore (supports glob patterns)
  -h, --help             help for covermyass
  -n, --iterations int   Overwrite N times instead of the default (default 3)
  -l, --list             Show files in a simple list format. This will prevent any write operation
      --no-read-only     Exclude read-only files in the list. Must be used with --list
  -v, --version          version for covermyass
      --write            Erase found log files. This WILL shred the files!
  -z, --zero             Add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding
```
