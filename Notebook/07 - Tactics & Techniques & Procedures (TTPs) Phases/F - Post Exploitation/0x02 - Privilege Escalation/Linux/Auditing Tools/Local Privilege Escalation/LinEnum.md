# LinEnum

Run the script to enumerate most of the basic enumeration and save the results in a different location. This is will on older systems as well.

```
$ ./LinEnum.sh -r enum-output -e /tmp/
```

More thorough enumeration but it's noisy. So keep that in mind.

```
$ ./LinEnum.sh -t
```

Supply a keyword

```
$ ./LinEnum.sh -k pass

$ ./LinEnum.sh -k password
```
