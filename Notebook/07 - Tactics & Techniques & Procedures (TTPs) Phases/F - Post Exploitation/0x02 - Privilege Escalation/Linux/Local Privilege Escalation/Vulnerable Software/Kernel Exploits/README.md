# Description

When enumerating for the kernel version manually through the manual steps on the Enumeration and Discovery section for [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/F - Post Exploitation/0x00 - Enumeration and Discovery/Desktop/Linux/Host/0xM - System and Kernel Version/Manual/Living off the Land]]. Once you're able to find the information with many ways to do it manually. Use the `searchsploit` tool to find the specific Linux kernel version. However I must give you warning and advise. Exploiting kernel vulnerabilities may have the potential to cause the Linux machine to crash I would suggest you to keep it as last resort or you don't have any other way.

After you've executed the command browse around a bit of any particular vulnerability you're looking yet I do have a better suggestion to make this procedure even faster if you're not aware of the popular kernel exploits and it keeps happening maybe a few months or a year ago. Keep up with the cybersecurity news in order to ensure you are well informed.

```
$ searchsploit linux kernel <version_number>
```

Sometimes enumerating manually can be daunting and especially in a non-simulated cyber intrusion attackers have little time to spare to go through those steps due to any reasonable circumstances. That's why other developers have made auditing tools that could help us save more time. I highly suggest with **Linux-Exploit-Suggester** or **LinPEAS** for this scenario. Head towards to **Auditing Tools** section.
