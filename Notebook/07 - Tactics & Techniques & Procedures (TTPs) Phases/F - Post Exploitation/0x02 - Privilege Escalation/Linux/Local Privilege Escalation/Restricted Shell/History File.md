# History File

set `HISTFILE` variable to a file you want to overwrite.

set `HISTSIZE` variable to `0` and then immediately to `100`.

Execute lines that you want to be written to your file.

Log out and log back in again. You have overwritten contents of the file `HISTFILE` pointed to (also, the original file permissions remained the same!)
