Looking for any file that is modifiable to anyone that can exploit the misconfigurations with root privileges. These methods are a quick way to search weak configurations and a few others.

```
$ find / -writable ! -user $(whoami) -type f ! -path "/proc/*" ! -path "/sys/*" -exec ls -al {} \; 2>/dev/null

$ find / ! -path "*/proc/*" -perm -2 -type f -print 2>/dev/null
```
