TODO: Provide a checklist for Sensitive Data Exposure

## Information Gathering

### Passive Reconnaissance

- [ ] Find common pattern of potential information disclosure in `robots.txt` via [[Robots and Sitemap|google dorks]].
- [ ] Use [[WaybackURLs]] to find previous potential sensitive data or information disclosure.

#### Passive Enumeration

- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x01 - Passive Fingerprinting/0xE - Enumeration via Network Protocols/HTTP/Webapp Information/Whatweb|whatweb]] to fingerprint the server. This includes:
	- Data Exposure
		- [ ] APIs
		- [ ] Source Repository Server
		- [ ] Credentials
		- [ ] Logs

### Active Reconnaissance

#### Active Enumeration

##### Discover Ports

- [ ] Probing ports to check what service version of the web servers using [[06 - Scan Techniques|nmap]].

##### Webserver Enumeration

- `robots.txt`
	- [ ] Run an [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Content/Web Directories/Robots/Scanners/Nmap|NSE script]] to discover `robots.txt` for exposed sensitive directories.
	- [ ] Run [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Content/Web Directories/Robots/Scanners/Nikto|nikto]] to discover `robots.txt` for exposed sensitive directories.
	- [ ] Run [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Content/Web Directories/Robots/Scanners/Nuclei|nuclei]] to discover `robots.txt` for exposed sensitive directories.
	- [ ] Run an [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Content/Web Directories/Robots/Scanners/Metasploit|auxiliary metasploit module]] to discover `robots.txt` for exposed sensitive directories.

- Exposed Directories
	- [ ] Check the [[Sensitive File List|common sensitive file list]] to find sensitive files.
	- [ ] Run an [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x02 - Active Fingerprinting/Enumeration via Network Protocols/HTTP/HTTP Proxy/Scanners/Nmap|NSE script]] to enumerate the web servers with `-iL ip_targets.txt` flag.
	- [ ] Perform directory bruteforce via [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Content/Web Directories/Bruteforce Directories/Gobuster|gobuster]].

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] Use [[Wapiti|wapiti]] to find potential exploits.
- [ ] Run [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Applications Forensics/Scanners/Nikto|nikto]] scanner to discover for existing vulnerabilities and information disclosure.
- [ ] Run an [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Applications Forensics/Scanners|NSE script]] to probe for information disclosure and vulnerabilities on the web servers with `-iL ip_targets.txt` flag.
- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Applications Forensics/Scanners/Nuclei|nuclei]] with default templates to discover configuration files exposed on the web servers.

#### Internet Information Services (IIS)

- [ ] Run [[IIS Short Name Scanner]] or [[Shortscan]] to check for short filenames.
