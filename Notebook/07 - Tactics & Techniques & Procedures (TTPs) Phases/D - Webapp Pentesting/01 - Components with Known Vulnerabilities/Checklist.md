TODO: Provide the checklist for public webapp exploits

## Information Gathering

### Passive Reconnaissance

- [ ] Find common parameters to vulnerable webapp components via google dorks.
	- [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x01 - Passive Fingerprinting/0xA - Search Engines/General Search Engines/Google Dorking/Dorks/Webapp Exploits/SQL Injection/Manual|manual google dorks]]
	- [[DorkSearch|dorksearch via LLM]]
	- [[Dorkscout|dorkscout]]

#### Passive Enumeration

- Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x01 - Passive Fingerprinting/0xD - Enumeration via Network Protocols/HTTP/Webapp Information/Whatweb|whatweb]] to fingerprint the server. This includes:
	- [ ] Web Server Software
	- Content Management System (CMS)
		- [ ] Plugins
		- [ ] Themes
	- [ ] Portals
	- [ ] Database Backend (DBMS)
	- [ ] Panels
	- [ ] Forums
	- [ ] Web Framework
	- Embedded devices/IoTs
		- [ ] Routers
		- [ ] Printers
		- [ ] CCTV cameras
		- [ ] VPN appliances
		- [ ] VoIP appliances
		- [ ] Network switches
		- [ ] Firewall hardware
		- [ ] Satellites
		- [ ] SCADA/ICS devices
	- Security Defenses
		- [ ] Web App Firewall (WAF) or IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
		- [ ] Honeypots

### Active Reconnaissance

#### Active Enumeration

##### Discover Ports

- [ ] Probing ports to check what service version using [[06 - Scan Techniques|nmap]].

##### Probe HTTP Port

- [ ] [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x02 - Active Fingerprinting/Network Enumeration/HTTP/01 - Banner Grab/Scanners|Banner Grab]]
- [ ] [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x02 - Active Fingerprinting/Network Enumeration/HTTP/02 - HTTP Title/Scanners|HTTP Title]]

##### Webapp Version

- [ ] [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/01 - Components with Known Vulnerabilities/Scanners]]

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/01 - Components with Known Vulnerabilities/Scanners|nuclei]] with a default templates to discover vulnerable webapp components.
- [ ] Run [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/01 - Components with Known Vulnerabilities/Scanners|nuclei]] scanner to discover for existing webapp exploits.
- [ ] Look for shellshock vulnerabilities in the [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/Command Injection/03 - Shellshock/Checklist|shellshock checklist]].

#### Content Management System

- [ ] Run [[02 - Basic Scan|WPScan]] to check for vulnerable wordpress plugins or themes.
- [ ] Run [[Joomscan]] to check for vulnerable joomla plugins or themes.

#### Internet Information Services (IIS)

- [ ] Probe for WebDAV on IIS5/6 for file upload via PUT method.
	- [[02 - PUT Upload|Davtest]]
	- [[Cadaver]]

#### Embedded Devices/IoTs

- [ ] [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/C - Initial Access/0x00 - Exploitation/0xB - Internet of Things (IoT)/Routers/Routers#^7d9f1e|Routersploit]] via `autopwn/scanner` module.

### Public Exploits
