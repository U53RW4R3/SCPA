## Other tags don't respect CSP

Note that in some deployments of CSP, the destination URLs for <img> tags may be restricted for non-security reasons; in these cases, the attacker is free to leverage several other tags, including `<meta http-equiv="Refresh" ...>` - honored anywhere in the document in all popular browsers, and not subject to policy controls.
