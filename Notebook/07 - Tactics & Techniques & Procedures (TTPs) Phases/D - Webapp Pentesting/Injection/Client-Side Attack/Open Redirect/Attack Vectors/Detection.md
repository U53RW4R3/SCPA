# Detection

## JavaScript Execution

The attacker could redirect to a javascript URI. This only works in the case of DOM-based Open Redirect. It would not work in server-side open redirects, for example in the case of a manipulated HTTP location header. Because of this attack vector, DOM open redirect is a XSS flaw.

```
https://example.com/#javascript:alert(document.cookie)
```
