# Checklist

TODO: Provide more list for the SSTI checklist

## Information Gathering

### Passive Reconnaissance

#### Passive Enumeration

- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x01 - Passive Fingerprinting/0xD - Network Ports/HTTP/Webapp Information/Whatweb|whatweb]] to fingerprint the server. This includes:
	- [ ] Web Server Software
	- Content Management System (CMS)
		- [ ] Plugins
		- [ ] Themes
	- [ ] Portals
	- [ ] Database Backend (DBMS)
	- [ ] Panels
	- [ ] Forums
	- [ ] Web Framework/Webapp Component
	- Embedded devices/IoTs
		- [ ] Routers
		- [ ] Printers
		- [ ] CCTV cameras
		- [ ] VPN appliances/Firewall Hardware
		- [ ] VoIP appliances
		- [ ] Projectors
		- [ ] Network switches
		- [ ] Satellites
		- Operation Technology (OT)
			- [ ] SCADA/ICS devices
	- General information
		- [ ] IP Addresses
		- [ ] Generator Tags
	- [ ] [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/0x03 - Bypass Webapp Security/Web Application Firewall (WAF)/Checklist|Security Defenses]]

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] You can use XSS scanners to perform and inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads for heuristic checks as a probable indicator for SSTI exploits.

- [ ] Use [[Webapps|Nuclei]] with fuzzer templates to discover GET request URLs with SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Exploit

- [ ] Inject XSS payloads as a probable indicator for SSTI exploit.
- [ ] Perform mathematical expressions.

### Manual Injection on Headers

- [ ] Inject `Cookie` headers
- [ ] Inject `User-Agent`
- [ ] Inject `Referrer`
- [ ] Inject `From`
- [ ] Inject `Forwarded`
- [ ] Inject `CF-Connecting-IP`
- [ ] Inject `Contact`
- [ ] Inject `Client-IP`
- [ ] Inject `Real-IP`
- [ ] Inject `True-Client-IP`
- [ ] Inject `X-Client-IP`
- [ ] Inject `X-Forwarded-For`
- [ ] Inject `X-Forwarded-Host`
- [ ] Inject `X-Originating-IP`
- [ ] Inject `X-WAP-Profile`
