# Checklist

## Information Gathering

### Passive Reconnaissance

#### Passive Enumeration

TODO: Fill this info

- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x01 - Passive Fingerprinting/0xD - Network Enumeration/Network Protocols/HTTP/Webapp Information/Whatweb|whatweb]] to fingerprint the server. This includes:
	- [ ] Web Server Software
	- Content Management System (CMS)
		- [ ] Plugins
		- [ ] Themes
	- [ ] Portals
	- [ ] Database Backend (DBMS)
	- [ ] Panels
	- [ ] Forums
	- [ ] Web Framework/Webapp Component
	- Embedded devices/IoTs
		- [ ] Routers
		- [ ] Printers
		- [ ] CCTV cameras
		- [ ] VPN appliances/Firewall Hardware
		- [ ] VoIP appliances
		- [ ] Projectors
		- [ ] Network switches
		- [ ] Satellites
		- Operation Technology (OT)
			- [ ] SCADA/ICS devices
	- General information
		- [ ] IP Addresses
		- [ ] Generator Tags
	- [ ] [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/0x02 - Bypass Webapp Security/Web Application Firewall (WAF)/Checklist|Security Defenses]]

### Active Enumeration

- [ ] Probing ports to check what service version of the web servers using [[06 - Scan Techniques|nmap]].
- [ ] Find common directories with a list of [[Shellshock List|Common Gateway Interface (CGI)]] or perform [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/0x04 - Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Content Discovery/Web Directories/Bruteforce Directories/Metasploit|web crawling or directory bruteforce]].
- [ ] Perform [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/0x04 - Sensitive Data Exposure/Web Content Discovery/Web Directories/Bruteforce Directories/Metasploit|directory bruteforce]] after checking CGIs directories on the webserver to find specific file extensions: `.sh`, `.pl`, and `.py`.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] Run [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/Command Injection/Helpers/Scanners|nikto]] scanner to discover for existing shellshock exploits.
- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/Command Injection/Helpers/Scanners|wapiti]] to find potential shellshock exploits.
- [ ] Run an [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/Command Injection/Helpers/Scanners|NSE script]] to probe for shellshock vulnerabilities on the web servers with `-iL ip_targets.txt`.

## Exploit

- [ ] Run with [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/Command Injection/04 - Automated Exploitation/Commix/Usage/Commix|commix]] using the `--shellshock` module to test for command injections.
