# Checklist

## Information Gathering

### Passive Reconnaissance

#### Passive Enumeration

- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x01 - Passive Fingerprinting/0xD - Network Enumeration/Network Protocols/HTTP/Webapp Information/Whatweb|whatweb]] to fingerprint the server. This includes:
	- [ ] Web Server Software
	- Content Management System (CMS)
		- [ ] Plugins
		- [ ] Themes
	- [ ] Portals
	- [ ] Database Backend (DBMS)
	- [ ] Panels
	- [ ] Forums
	- [ ] Web Framework
	- General information
		- [ ] Author
		- [ ] Emails
		- [ ] IP Addresses
		- [ ] Country
		- [ ] Geolocation
		- [ ] Generator Tags
	- Security Defenses
		- [ ] Web App Firewall (WAF) or IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
		- [ ] Honeypots

#### Discover Hidden Parameters

- [ ] Find common parameters to perform SQL injection via google dorks.

- [ ] Browse the website with OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to see any potential interest.

### Active Reconnaissance

#### Active Enumeration

##### Discover Ports

- [ ] Probing ports to check what service version of the web servers using [[06 - Scan Techniques|nmap]].

##### Fuzz Hidden Parameters

- [ ] You can use scanners to discover hidden parameters that can be used for further enumeration.
	- [[Arjun]]
	- [[x8]]
- [ ] Bruteforce hidden parameters.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/B - Vulnerability Assessment/01 - Scanners/Web Vulnerability Scanner/Wapiti/Usage/02 - Basic|wapiti]] to find potential SQL injection exploits.
- [ ] Run [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/SQL Injection/Helpers/Scanners|nikto]] scanner to discover for existing SQL injection exploits.
- [ ] You can use XSS scanners to perform and inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads for heuristic checks as a probable indicator for SQL injection exploits.

	- [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Client-Side Attack/Cross Site Scripting (XSS)/Automated Exploitation/XSSer|XSSer]]
	- [[XSStrike|XSStrike]]
- [ ] Run an [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/SQL Injection/Helpers/Scanners|nmap NSE script]] to probe for SQL injection vulnerabilities on the web servers with `-iL ip_targets.txt` flag.
- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/SQL Injection/Helpers/Scanners|nuclei]] with fuzzer templates to discover GET request URLs with SQL injection vulnerabilities and other indicators of PHP syntax code disclosure.
- [ ] Run [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/SQL Injection/Helpers/Scanners|metasploit]] auxiliary scanner module to find SQL injection vulnerabilities on the web servers.

#### Content Management System

- [ ] Run [[02 - Basic Scan|WPScan]] to check for vulnerable wordpress plugins or themes related to SQL injection.
- [ ] Run [[Joomscan]] to check for vulnerable joomla plugins or themes related to SQL injection.

## Exploit

### Manual Injection on Parameters

- [ ] Refer to [[02 - Boundaries]] to aid to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Common Parameters

- [ ] Check the top parameters in [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/SQL Injection/Helpers/Dorks/Google Dorks/Manual|google dorks]].

#### GET Request

- [ ] Check the URL parameters.
- [ ] Check the URI parameters.
- [ ] Perform on numeric parameters with mathematical expression as a probable indicator for SQL injection. In **SQLMap** this can be possible with `--invalid-bignum` flag.
- [ ] Perform on parameters with logical operators as a probable indicator for SQL injection. In **SQLMap** this can be possible with `--invalid-logical` flag.
- [ ] Perform on parameters with random strings as a probable indicator for SQL injection. In **SQLMap** this can be possible with `--invalid-string` flag.

#### POST Request

- [ ] Perform username enumeration to craft the SQL injection if necessary.
- [ ] Check JSON parameters.
- [ ] POST parameters may contain in SOAP/XML.

### Manual Injection on Headers

TODO: Fill the rest of the HTTP headers

- [ ] Inject **Cookie headers**
- [ ] Inject **User-Agent**
- [ ] Inject **Referrer**
- [ ] Inject **X-Forwarded-For**
- [ ] Inject **X-Forwarded-Host**

### SQL Injection Responses

#### Boolean-Based SQL Injection

##### Page Comparison

- Compare responses of what conditions are needed:
	- [ ] Trigger valid response of what input accepts.
	- [ ] Trigger invalid response of what input returns an error.
	- [ ] Conditional error response.
	- [ ] Observe title webpage response.
	- [ ] Observe HTTP status code.

##### Authentication Bypass

- [ ] Perform Boolean-based SQL injection to bypass authentication. In **SQLMap** you can specify `--technique=B` flag which allows you to dump the database credentials. Whatever based on your enumeration gathering based on the webapp response include these flags to narrow it down: 
	-  `--string` for single response or `--regexp` multiple responses if returned true. `--code=200` if HTTP code status is true or `--code=401` if HTTP code status is false.
	- `--not-string` for single response if returned false.
	- To perform another check to highest success rate of SQL injection exploit add `--titles` flag to compare the webpages based on title response.

#### UNION-Based SQL Injection

- [ ] Enumerate number of fields manually with the following queries:
	- `ORDER BY n`
	- `GROUP BY n`
	- `UNION [ALL] SELECT n`
- [ ] In **SQLMap** using the UNION query (`--technique=U`).  To narrow it down:
	- `--union-cols` to specify number of fields.
	- `--union-from` to enforce UNION query technique. in some DBMS(es) instances such as, **Microsoft Access** requires table to validate the response.

#### Error-Based SQL Injection

- [ ] In **SQLMap** using the Error-based query (`--technique=E`).

### Data Collection

#### Login Panels

- [ ] Find an login (admin) panel to login the credentials you've obtained from the current database. Use [[Gobuster|gobuster]] if you must.
- [ ] If possible you can use other two in-band SQL injection techniques, otherwise stick with boolean-based technique.

#### DBMS Credentials

- [ ] After you successfully exploited the parameters. Extract the DBMS credentials to authenticate the database server. You can perform this in [[05 - Credentials|SQLMap]].
- [ ] Run a port scanner to discover DBMS open ports.
	- [[01 - Quick Scan|Network Mapper]]
	- [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x02 - Active Fingerprinting/Port Scanners/Naabu|Naabu]]

### Initial Foothold

#### Webshell

TODO: Write more about this

##### Enumerate Web Root Directory

- Discover and enumerate the web root directory.
	- [ ] Find syntax errors or warning messages to find a web root directory.
	- [ ] A directory path where to upload files.

##### Upload File

- [ ] After successfully exploiting SQL injection. Upload a webshell if possible.

### Exploit Chaining

- [ ] If **SQLMap** detects the SQL injection parameters with positive heuristic checks of XSS. Craft an [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Client-Side Attack/Cross Site Scripting (XSS)/Attack Vectors/01 - DVWA/Stored XSS/Manual#^a7f343|XSS payload]] then insert it in the database to steal cookie sessions.
