## Information Gathering

### Passive Reconnaissance

#### Passive Enumeration

- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/01 - Passive Fingerprinting/Enumeration via Network Protocols/HTTP/Webapp Information/Whatweb|whatweb]] to fingerprint the server. This includes:
	- [ ] Web Server Software
	- Content Management System (CMS)
		- [ ] Plugins
		- [ ] Themes
	- [ ] Portals
	- [ ] Database Backend (DBMS)
	- [ ] Panels
	- [ ] Forums
	- [ ] Web Framework
	- Security Defenses
		- [ ] Web App Firewall (WAF) or IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
		- [ ] Honeypots

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] You can use XSS scanners to perform and inject Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads for heuristic checks as a probable indicator for SSTI exploits.

- [ ] Use [[Webapps|Nuclei]] with fuzzer templates to discover GET request URLs with SSTI vulnerabilities.

## Exploit

- [ ] Inject XSS payloads as a probable indicator for SSTI exploit.
- [ ] Perform mathematical expressions.

### Manual Injection on Headers

- [ ] Inject **Cookie headers**
- [ ] Inject **User-Agent**
- [ ] Inject **Referrer**
- [ ] Inject **X-Forwarded-For**
