Bluelog (v1.1.2) by Tom Nardi "MS3FGX" (MS3FGX@gmail.com)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Bluelog is a Bluetooth site survey tool, designed to tell you how
many discoverable devices there are in an area as quickly as possible.
As the name implies, its primary function is to log discovered devices
to file rather than to be used interactively. Bluelog could run on a
system unattended for long periods of time to collect data.

Bluelog also includes a mode called "Bluelog Live" which creates a
webpage of the results that you can serve up with your HTTP daemon of
choice. See the "README.LIVE" file for details.

For more information, see: www.digifail.com
