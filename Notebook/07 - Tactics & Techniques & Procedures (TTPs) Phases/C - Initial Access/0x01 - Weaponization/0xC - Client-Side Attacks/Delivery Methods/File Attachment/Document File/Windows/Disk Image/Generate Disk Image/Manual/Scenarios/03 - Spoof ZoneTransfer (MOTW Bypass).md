| Zone Identifier | Description                                                                                                           |
| :-------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        0        | File originates from the local machine. It has the least security restriction.                                        |
|        1        | File originated from the local intranet (local network). Both zone identifier 0 and 1 indicate a high level of trust. |
|        2        | Indicates the file was downloaded from a trusted site. This can spoofed by attackers by manipulating the ADS.         |
|        3        | Indicates the file was downloaded from the internet and it is generally untrusted.                                    |
|        4        | Indicates that the file came from a likely unsafe source.                                                             |
