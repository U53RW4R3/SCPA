TODO: Provide a checklist for developing implants with a general context to improve evasion success rate

## Data Integrity

- [ ] Ensure your malware isn't tampered. Use digest hash algorithm.

## Whitelisting

- [ ] List of MAC Addresses.
- [ ] List of IP Addresses.
- Timezones
	- [ ] Local system-based timezone
	- [ ] Internet connected timezone
		- Using NTP (Network Time Protocol)
		- Using third-party services

## Blacklisting

- [ ] List of MAC Addresses.
- [ ] List of IP Addresses.
- Timezones
	- [ ] Local system-based timezone
	- [ ] Internet connected timezone
		- Using NTP (Network Time Protocol)
		- Using third-party services
- [ ] Block WinAPI and NtAPI code injection (look more into this for mapping DLLs).

## Greylisting

- [ ] It's in the form of both whitelisting and blacklisting.

## Anti-Sandbox
