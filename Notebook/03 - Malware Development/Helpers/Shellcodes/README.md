# Shellcodes

## Summary

Shellcodes are a sequence of bytes that includes a payload (a command, a shell, etc.),

Shellcodes is composed as follows :

- Recon of the target (if it uses `NX` or the old rights `RWX`).
- To uses a `NX Mitigation`, use `mprotect` or `mmap` to find a `RWX` rights area (ROP, fouling of `ebp`, and `eip`).
- Development in Assembly (architecture to define).
- At least one section (`.text`).
- Reduce the number of instructions to be quiet.
- The register `rax` (int64) or `eax` (int32) should be used to set to a sys (cf. syscall markdowns).
- `rax` or `eax` should be `mov` with a `sys_execve` (`59` for `rax`, `11` for `eax`).
- You have to set the register `rdi` to `<command>` (by a `mov` to command address).
- You have to initialize by a `xor` (to bypass `\0`, `\n`, or `\x20` which blocks the ROP) the registers `rsi` and `rdx`, and add a `/` to the command to remove other `NULL bytes`.
- Set a `syscall` at the end of the section (Userland -> libc -> Ring 0).
- Compile and disassemble (to see if there is not `NULL bytes` and if it's usable) :

```bash
$ nasm -f <bin32/64> shellcode.s -o shellcode.o
ld shellcode.o -o shellcode
objdump -d -Mintel ./shellcode
```

- Integration to an exploit (with bytes as `\x`).
