> [!INFO] Default Configuration
> The default configuration file is located in `/etc/proxychains.conf`.

Do not display the network chains when proxying the network.

```
# proxychains -q <program_name> [arguments]
```

Override the default configuration file

```
# proxychains -f socks.conf <program_name> [arguments]
```
