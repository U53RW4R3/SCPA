# Linux Smart Enumeration

Once you've executed the script it will ask for a password but as an attacker we are facing a black box target that we have no information. Press the Return key and it will perform the scan to look for high priority results. It will print with readable output colors to make it easier for us to find. Finally this script will run on older Linux systems and embedded devices as well

To execute script on memory.

```
$ bash <(wget --no-hsts -qO - "https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration/releases/latest/download/lse.sh") -l2 -i

$ bash <(curl -s "https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration/releases/latest/download/lse.sh") -l1 -i
```

To drop the script on disk.

```
$ wget -O lse.sh "https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration/releases/latest/download/lse.sh"; chmod 755 lse.sh

$ ./lse.sh
```

Skip for a password prompt.

```
$ ./lse.sh -i
```

Display not just only the important critical findings but other interesting things such as virtualized containers, networks, running processes, cron jobs, etc...

```
$ ./lse.sh -l 1
```

Show every results it could find and non-interactive mode

```
$ ./lse.sh -il 2
```

Select a few sections or tests to run of the following sections. I would enumerate every single Linux machine with just these options to make it quick.

```
$ ./lse.sh -is usr,sud,sys,ret,net,srv,pro
```
