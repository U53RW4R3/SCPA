# ASLR

> [!INFO] ASLR Values
> `0`: No randomization. Everything is static.
> `1`: Conservative randomization. Shared libraries, stack, `mmap()`, VDSO and heap are randomized.
> `2`: Full randomization. In addition to elements listed in the previous point, memory managed through `brk()` is also randomized.
