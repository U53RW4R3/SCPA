# Enumerate

List all commands that the current shell knows about

```
$ compgen -c
```

The first step should be to gather a little information. You'll need to know your environment. Run the `env` command to understand how your profile is configured. You'll see which shell you're running and where your `PATH` is pointing to. Once you know what your `PATH` is, list the contents of the directory (i.e. `ls /usr/local/rbin`) to see which commands are present. It is possible you may not be able to run the `ls` command. If not, you can use the `echo` command with an asterisk to `glob` directory contents if it's available:

```
$ echo /usr/local/rbin/*
```

You can continue on through the file system using this command to help you find other files and commands. Basically, you'll be armed with built-in shell commands as well as the ones listed in your PATH. This is your arsenal for attacking the restricted shell, but there may be exceptions as we'll find out. Once you know which commands you can execute, research each one of them to see if there are known shell escapes associated with them. Some of the techniques we're about to get into can be combined together. Start trying commands to see what programs you have access.

```
$ env

$ export

$ echo $SHELL

$ echo $PATH

$ ls $PATH
```
