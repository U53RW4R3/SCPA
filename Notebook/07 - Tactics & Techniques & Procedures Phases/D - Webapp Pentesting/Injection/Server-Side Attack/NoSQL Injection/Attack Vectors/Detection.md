# Detection

The MongoDB API expects BSON (Binary JSON) calls, and includes a secure BSON query assembly tool. However, according to MongoDB documentation - unserialized JSON and JavaScript expressions are permitted in several alternative query parameters. The most commonly used API call allowing arbitrary JavaScript input is the `$where` operator.

The MongoDB `$where` operator typically is used as a simple filter or check, as it is within SQL.

```
db.myCollection.find( { $where: "this.credits == this.debits" } );
```

Optionally JavaScript is also evaluated to allow more advanced conditions.

```
db.myCollection.find( { $where: function() { return obj.credits - obj.debits < 0; } } );
```
