## Information Gathering

### Passive Reconnaissance

#### Passive Enumeration

- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x01 - Passive Fingerprinting/0xD - Network Ports/HTTP/Webapp Information/Whatweb|whatweb]] to fingerprint the server. This includes:
	- [ ] Web Server Software
	- Content Management System (CMS)
		- [ ] Plugins
		- [ ] Themes
	- [ ] Portals
	- [ ] Database Backend (DBMS)
	- [ ] Panels
	- [ ] Forums
	- [ ] Web Framework
	- Embedded devices/IoTs
		- [ ] Routers
		- [ ] VPN appliances
	- General information
		- [ ] Author
		- [ ] Emails
		- [ ] IP Addresses
		- [ ] Country
		- [ ] Geolocation
		- [ ] Generator Tags
	- Security Defenses
		- [ ] Web App Firewall (WAF) or IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
		- [ ] Honeypots

### Active Reconnaissance

#### Active Enumeration

- [ ] Enter an non-existent URL that would result an open redirect response.
- [ ] Look for HTTP codes 302 (found) and/or 301 (redirect) that may contain open redirects or content bypass.

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/0x01 - WebApp Security Scanners/Wapiti/01 - Basic|wapiti]] to find potential SSRF exploits.
- [ ] You can use scanners to perform open redirects to inject redirect links.
	- [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Client-Side Attack/Open Redirect/Helpers/Scanners#03 - OpenRedireX|OpenRedireX]]
	- [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Client-Side Attack/Open Redirect/Helpers/Scanners#04 - Oralyzer|Oralyzer]]
- [ ] Run an [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Client-Side Attack/Open Redirect/Helpers/Scanners#02 - Network Mapper|NSE script]] to probe for open redirect vulnerabilities on the web servers with `-iL ip_targets.txt` flag.
- [ ] Use [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Client-Side Attack/Open Redirect/Helpers/Scanners#01 - Nuclei|nuclei]] with fuzzer templates to discover GET request URLs with open redirect vulnerabilities.

#### Content Management System (CMS)

- [ ] Run [[02 - Basic Scan|WPScan]] to check for vulnerable wordpress plugins or themes related to SSRF exploits.

## Exploit

### Manual Injection on Parameters

#### Common Parameters

- [ ] Check the top parameters in **google dorks**.

#### GET Request

- [ ] Check the URL parameters.

### Open Redirect Responses

- [ ] HTTP redirect status codes
	- [300 Multiple Choices](https://httpstatuses.com/300) - This indicates that the request has more than one possible response. The client should choose one of them.
	- [301 Moved Permanently](https://httpstatuses.com/301) - This means that the resource requested has been permanently moved to the URL given by the Location headers. All future requests should use the new URI.
	- [302 Found](https://httpstatuses.com/302) - This response code means that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL given by the Location headers. Unlike 301, it does not mean that the resource has been permanently moved, just that it is temporarily located somewhere else.
	- [303 See Other](https://httpstatuses.com/303) - The server sends this response to direct the client to get the requested resource at another URI with a GET request.
	- [304 Not Modified](https://httpstatuses.com/304) - This is used for caching purposes. It tells the client that the response has not been modified, so the client can continue to use the same cached version of the response.
	- [305 Use Proxy](https://httpstatuses.com/305) - The requested resource must be accessed through a proxy provided in the Location header.
	- [307 Temporary Redirect](https://httpstatuses.com/307) - This means that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL given by the Location headers, and future requests should still use the original URI.
	- [308 Permanent Redirect](https://httpstatuses.com/308) - This means the resource has been permanently moved to the URL given by the Location headers, and future requests should use the new URI. It is similar to 301 but does not allow the HTTP method to change.
