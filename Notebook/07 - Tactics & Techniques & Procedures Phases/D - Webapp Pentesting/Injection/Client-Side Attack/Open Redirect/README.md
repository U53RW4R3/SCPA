Open redirectors take you from a Google URL to another website chosen by whoever constructed the link. Some members of the security community argue that the redirectors aid phishing, because users may be inclined to trust the mouse hover tooltip on a link and then fail to examine the address bar once the navigation takes place.

There are several ways to attack redirects whether it is an open direct, the page doesn't check its referrer, or otherwise. Redirects can be dangerous by forwarded the user to an unintended location or even given the user access to a page they normally wouldn't have access to (since the domain is referring itself OR to somewhere external to the domain). 

## Types of Open Redirects

### Reflected

Reflected Open Redirect occurs when user input is immediately causing a web application to redirect the user to a web resource of the attacker's choosing.

### Persistent

Persistent Open Redirect occurs when user input is stored on the target server, such as in a database, in a username, visitor log, comment field, etc. The redirection is then caused due to the user input being returned to one or many users.

### DOM-based

In some cases, the user provided data may never even leave the browser (e.g. manipulation of `document.location.href`). The attack payload might also be permanently stored in the victim's browser (e.g. HTML5 database).
