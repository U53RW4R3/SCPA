dpl4hydra v0.9.9 (c) 2012 by Roland Kessler (@rokessler)

Syntax: dpl4hydra [help] | [refresh] | [BRAND] | [all]

This script depends on a local (d)efault (p)assword (l)ist called
/home/userware/.dpl4hydra/dpl4hydra_full.csv. If it is not available, regenerate it with
'dpl4hydra refresh'. Source of the default password list is
http://open-sez.me

Options:
  help        Help: Show this message
  refresh     Refresh list: Download the full (d)efault (p)assword (l)ist
              and generate a new local /home/grayfox/.dpl4hydra/dpl4hydra_full.csv file. Takes time!
  BRAND       Generates a (d)efault (p)assword (l)ist from the local file
              /home/userware/.dpl4hydra/dpl4hydra_full.csv, limiting the output to BRAND systems, using
              the format username:password (as required by THC hydra).
              The output file is called dpl4hydra_BRAND.lst.
  all         Dump list of all systems credentials into dpl4hydra_all.lst.

Example:
$ dpl4hydra linksys
File dpl4hydra_linksys.lst was created with 20 entries.
$ hydra -C ./dpl4hydra_linksys.lst -t 1 192.168.1.1 http-get /index.asp
```
