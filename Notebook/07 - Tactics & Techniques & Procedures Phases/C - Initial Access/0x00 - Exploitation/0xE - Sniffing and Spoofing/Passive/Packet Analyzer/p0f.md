$ p0f
--- p0f 3.09b by Michal Zalewski <lcamtuf@coredump.cx> ---
Usage: p0f [ ...options... ] [ 'filter rule' ]

Network interface options:

  -i iface  - listen on the specified network interface
  -r file   - read offline pcap data from a given file
  -p        - put the listening interface in promiscuous mode
  -L        - list all available interfaces

Operating mode and output settings:

  -f file   - read fingerprint database from 'file' (/etc/p0f/p0f.fp)
  -o file   - write information to the specified log file
  -s name   - answer to API queries at a named unix socket
  -u user   - switch to the specified unprivileged account and chroot
  -d        - fork into background (requires -o or -s)

Performance-related options:

  -S limit  - limit number of parallel API connections (20)
  -t c,h    - set connection / host cache age limits (30s,120m)
  -m c,h    - cap the number of active connections / hosts (1000,10000)

Optional filter expressions (man tcpdump) can be specified in the command
line to prevent p0f from looking at incidental network traffic.

## 03 - Usage

List available interfaces

```
$ p0f -L
```

Start sniffing passively from incoming and outgoing connections.

```
$ sudo p0f [-i <interface>] -u <username> [-d] -o /var/log/p0f.log

$ sudo p0f [-i <interface>] -u games [-d] -o /var/log/p0f.log
```

Read the captured packets (`.pcap` or `.cap`) after using [[TCPDump|tcpdump]] or [[07 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures Phases/C - Initial Access/0x00 - Exploitation/0xE - Sniffing and Spoofing/Passive/Packet Analyzer/Wireshark|wireshark]].

```
$ p0f -r file.pcap
```
