# VBA

## String Substitution

### Replace Strings

```vb
Dim text As String
text = "text text text, all you write is text"
text = Replace(text, "text", "pizza")
MsgBox text
```

### Random Number

```vb
Public Function RandomNumber(startNum As Integer, endNum As Integer) As Integer
    Randomize
    RandomNumber = Int(((endNum - startNum + 1) * Rnd) + startNum)
End Function

Dim x As Integer
x = RandomNumber(10, 20)
MsgBox x
```

## Scramble a Series of Words

```vb
' generates a random number in a given range
Public Function RandomNumber(startNum As Integer, endNum As Integer) As Integer
    Randomize
    RandomNumber = Int(((endNum - startNum + 1) * Rnd) + startNum)
End Function

' swaps two characters in a string
Public Function swap(text As String, pos1 As Integer, pos2 As Integer)
    Dim temp As String
    temp = Mid(text, pos1, 1)
    text = Mid(text, 1, pos1 - 1) + Mid(text, pos2, 1) + Mid(text, pos1 + 1)
    text = Mid(text, 1, pos2 - 1) + temp + Mid(text, pos2 + 1)
    swap = text
End Function

' scrambles a word
Public Function scrambleWord(ByVal text As String)
    Dim scrambleStrength As Integer, pos1 As Integer, pos2 As Integer
    Dim i As Integer
    
    ' probably doesn't need to be higher than this
    scrambleStrength = (Len(text) - 1) * 2
   
    For i = 0 To scrambleStrength
        pos1 = RandomNumber(1, Len(text))
        pos2 = RandomNumber(1, Len(text))
        text = swap(text, pos1, pos2)
    Next
  
    scrambleWord = text
End Function

Public Function scrambleInput(text As String)
    Dim words() As String, i As Integer
    words = Split(text, " ") ' split is a VB function for breaking a string into an array of strings
    For i = 0 To UBound(words)
        ' scramble each word
        words(i) = scrambleWord(words(i))
    Next
    
    ' output a string of the scrambled text
    scrambleInput = Join(words, " ")
End Function
```
