Function getLoadedCount() As Double
    Dim programINI As String, countString As String, countNum As Double
    programINI = App.Path & App.EXEName & "_info.ini"
    
    ' See if an ini has been created, if not, create the file and set the
    ' number of times this program has been loaded to 1
    If Len(Dir(programINI)) = 0 Then
        ' Create an ini to hold the number of times the program is opened
        Open programINI For Output As #1
        Print #1, "Times Loaded: 1"
        Close #1
