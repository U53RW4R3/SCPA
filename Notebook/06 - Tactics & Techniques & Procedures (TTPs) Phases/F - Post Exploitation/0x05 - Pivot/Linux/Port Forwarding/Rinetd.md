# Rinetd

## Setup

The `rinetd` program is short for **Internet Redirection Server** is self-explanatory as it suggests for port forwarding. 

### Package Manager

Install it according to your package manager.

```
$ sudo apt install -y rinetd

$ sudo dnf install -y rinetd

$ yay -S --noconfirm rinetd
```

## Server

We as an attacker must make a server as a phishing/honeypot to fetch credentials to prepare some kind of social engineering in the network of whatever enterprise organization due to varies situations or another way to evade blacklisted IP addresses in the local network. We need a port forwarding to redirect the traffic to make it look normal.

```
# cat > /etc/rinetd.conf << EOF
# bindaddress   bindport  connectaddress  connectport
<LHOST>     <LPORT>     <FHOST>     <FPORT>
EOF
```

Restart the service to apply changes in the configuration.

```
$ sudo service rinetd restart

$ sudo systemctl restart rinetd
```
