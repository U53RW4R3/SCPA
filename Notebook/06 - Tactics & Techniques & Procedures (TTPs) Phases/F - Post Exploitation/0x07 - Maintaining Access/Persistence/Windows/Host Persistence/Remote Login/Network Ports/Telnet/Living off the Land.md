## 01 - Telnet Server

### 1.1 - Command Prompt

Until Windows 10, all Windows came with a **Telnet server** that you could install as administrator:

```
C:\> Dism.exe /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetServer

C:\> pkgmgr.exe /iu:"TelnetServer" /quiet
```

Make it **start** when the system is started and **run** it now:

```
C:\> sc.exe config TlntSVR start= auto obj= localsystem
```

Change telnet port (stealth) and disable firewall:

```
C:\> tlntadmn.exe config port=80

C:\> netsh.exe advfirewall set allprofiles state off
```

To uninstall telnet server.

```
C:\> Dism.exe /Online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetServer
```
