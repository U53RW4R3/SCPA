# Self Duplicate File

## Scripting

### Python

```python
from sys import argv
from random import choice, randint
from string import ascii_letters as alphabets

def self_duplicate_binary_file() -> None:
    '''
    Write the binary data to duplicate itself.
    It doesn't use any external commands to copy itself.
    No for loop but you can make it.
    '''

    # Randomize the string when creating a unique filename
    random_string = lambda length: "".join([choice(alphabets) for x in range(length)] + ".exe")

    filename = random_string(randint(4, 8))
    self_script = argv[0] # For self-replication

    # Read the data
    with open(self_script, 'rb') as file:
        data = file.read()

    with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    self_duplicate_binary_file()
