# Exploit Chaining

## CSRF GET HTTP Request via Open Redirect

Assume a open redirect in a trusted website that also has a GET-based CSRF flaw. The attacker would be able to redirect the victims in order to make them execute the vulnerable functionality.

```
https://example.com/?u=https://example.com/?del_user=1
```

### Outdated Web Browser

The most obvious attack vector would be to redirect to a malicious website. The attack vector's impact will be limited by the victim's browser (e.g. very high if outdated/vulnerable).

```
https://example.com/?u=https://<attacker_IP>
```
