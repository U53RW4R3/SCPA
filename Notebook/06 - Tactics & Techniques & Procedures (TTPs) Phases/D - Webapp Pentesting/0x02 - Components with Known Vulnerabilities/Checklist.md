#### Passive Enumeration

- [ ] Use [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/A - Information Gathering/0x01 - Passive Fingerprinting/0xD - Network Ports/HTTP/Webapp Information/Whatweb|whatweb]] to fingerprint the server.
- [ ] View source page for old copyright date.

### Active Reconnaissance

#### Active Enumeration

##### Discover Ports

- [ ] Probing ports to check what service version using [[02 - Scan Techniques|nmap]].

##### Probe HTTP Port

## Vulnerability Assessment

### Scanners

#### General

- [ ] Use [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/0x02 - Components with Known Vulnerabilities/Helpers/Scanners|nuclei]] with a default templates to discover vulnerable webapp components.
- [ ] Run [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/0x02 - Components with Known Vulnerabilities/Helpers/Scanners|nuclei]] scanner to discover for existing webapp exploits.
- [ ] Look for shellshock vulnerabilities in the [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/D - Webapp Pentesting/Injection/Server-Side Attack/Command Injection/03 - CGI/Checklist|shellshock checklist]].

#### Content Management System

- [ ] Run [[02 - Basic Scan|WPScan]] to check for vulnerable wordpress plugins or themes.
- [ ] Run [[Joomscan]] to check for vulnerable joomla plugins or themes.

#### Internet Information Services (IIS)

- [ ] Probe for WebDAV on IIS5/6 for file upload via PUT method.
	- [[02 - PUT Upload|Davtest]]
	- [[Cadaver]]

#### Embedded Devices/IoTs

- [ ] [[06 - Tactics & Techniques & Procedures (TTPs) Phases/C - Initial Access/0x00 - Exploitation/0xB - Internet of Things (IoT)/Routers/Routers#^7d9f1e|Routersploit]] via `autopwn/scanner` module.
