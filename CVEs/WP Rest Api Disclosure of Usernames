By default most Wordpress admin username is set to admin , but if not and your targetted wordpress site is does not restrict users from accessing parts of the site.
(no 403 protection)
You can mostly find the author / admin username here .
https://targeturl/wp-json/wp/v2/users
then try the names on wp-login.php with invalid password
if username exist response will be invalid password for the user  

more of a misconfig.
